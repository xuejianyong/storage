Abstract 1 Behavior can be conceived as the result of a sequence in which the outcomes of perceptual decisions 2 inform decisions on which action to take. However, the relationship between these processes, and 3 spatiotemporal dynamics of the visual-to-motor transformation remains unclear. Here, we 4 combined accumulation-to-threshold models and electro-magnetoencephalography, to trace neural 5 correlates of sensorimotor decisions in space, time and frequency. We challenge the assumption of 6 sequential decisions, with evidence that visuomotor processing unfolds through a continuous flow 7 of information from sensory to motor regions. Action selection is initiated before regional visual 8 decisions are completed. By linking behavior and physiology through theoretical decision models, 9 we identify simultaneous forward and backward flow of information for visuomotor decisions 10 between sensory and motor regions, in beta and gamma ranges. The model of integrated visuomotor 11 decisions provides a powerful approach to investigate behavioral disorders that impair the ability 12 to use sensory inputs to guide appropriate actions.

13 Introduction 14 15 Human behaviors are the result of many decisions, from early or automatic perceptual inferences 16 about our environment to complex goal-directed choices between alternate courses of action. Three 17 broad lines of research have made separate contributions to understanding such decisions. First, 18 the psychophysical analysis of visuomotor task performance and reaction times, in health1 or in the 19 presence of focal2 and degenerative brain lesions3. Second, the functional anatomical analysis of 20 decision making using brain imaging and neurophysiology, including paradigms that manipulate 21 visual uncertainty4, action selection5, or outcome evaluation6. Third, the development of 22 computational models of how decisions can be reached, at the level of neuronal ensembles7 or 23 groups of individuals8. 24 25 It remains a challenge however, to bring these separate lines of enquiry together in a unified model 26 of neurophysiologically informed decision process, embedded in a functional anatomical 27 framework, to explain the transformation of noisy visual inputs to alternative motor outputs. The 28 anatomical framework has an additional requirement, which is to accommodate the evidence for 29 functional segregation between sensory and motor areas at the same time as allowing the flow of 30 information through hierarchical and distributed brain networks. Here we propose an integrated 31 account of visuomotor decision-making, as summarised in Fig. 1, working from a novel visuomotor 32 task that adjusts sensory and action uncertainty during functional brain imaging by combined 33 electro-/magnetoencephalography (MEEG). 34 35 In mathematical psychology it has been argued that decisions and their latencies are controlled by 36 when the cumulative evidence in favour of a choice reaches a criterion decision threshold9. We 37 identify the accumulation-to-threshold of latent variables representing sensory evidences, based on 38 the transformation of visual signals into evidence about the behaviorally relevant stimulus features 39 (perceptual decisions10,11); and the analogous evidence for motor schema, which have been termed 40 motor intentions (action decisions12,13). 41 42 Rather than arbitrarily divide visual from motor transformations, we investigated their associated 43 decision processes by separately manipulating uncertainty in the identity of visual features 44 (perceptual uncertainty11, by variable motion coherence) and range of possible actions (action 45 uncertainty13,14, by variable number of response options).The task combined elements of the classic

46 motion discrimination task11 with a response selection task13: noisy visual stimuli indicated the one 47 or more response options, which were executed by pressing a corresponding button (Fig. 2). By 48 manipulating motion coherence in the random dots stimuli and the number of offered choices, we 49 sought to isolate the neural signatures of decision-evidence accumulation for perceptual and action 50 decisions, respectively. 51
52 53 Figure 1. Overview of the study. We combined behavioural, computational, and neuroimaging approaches 54 to provide an integrated perspective of the decision processes linking perception to action. Each section is 55 expanded in a subsequent figure, as directed. 56 57 58 Several brain regions have been identified that accumulate perceptual evidence10,11 and motor 59 intentions12,13. However, it is necessary to understand how a network of accumulator regions

60 orchestrates their activity for the critical transformation between perceptual and action decisions. 61 Specifically, we sought to distinguish (i) a serial process15 where perceptual decisions are complete 62 and their output passed to motor accumulators, from (ii) a continuous flow of information16, through 63 perceptual to associative and motor regions before completion of perceptual analysis. A serial 64 process would be robust to error, but continuous flow would enable faster action decisions. To 65 differentiate these alternatives, we mapped the modelled temporal profile of evidence accumulation 66 to MEEG induced power17, trial-by-trial. The temporal evolution of predicted evidence was based 67 on behaviorally optimized generative linear ballistic accumulator model of the decision. 68 69
70 71 Figure 2. Experimental manipulation of perceptual and action uncertainty. Participants pressed the 72 button corresponding to the coherent stimulus (red downward arrow). When there were more than one 73 coherent stimulus, they selected one response and pressed the corresponding button. Perceptual uncertainty 74 was manipulated by changing the coherence of dot motion (i.e. by changing the motion strength), whereas 75 action uncertainty was manipulated by changing the number of available options (i.e. the number of coherent 76 stimuli to choose from). Perceptual and action uncertainty varied across trials in a 2 by 2 factorial design.

77 78 We focused on the beta and gamma band power as the candidate correlates of the evidence for three 79 reasons. First, the growing evidence for separate functions of gamma and beta in the feedforward 80 and feedback of information respectively in hierarchical brain networks18. Second, that the 81 accumulation of evidence for perceptual choices correlates with gamma-frequency oscillations17. 82 Third, that the processes underlying the deliberation between alternate actions have been associated 83 with beta power modulation19,20. 84 85 The use of MEEG affords a source model of cortical generators21 and enables the functional 86 segregation of sensory and motor area, as well as areas where sensory-motor transformations occur. 87 Complementary connectivity measures (phase transfer entropy22) reveal the flow of information 88 between areas, orchestrating the emergence of decision-evidences across decision networks. 89 90 We show that evidence accumulation in motor and prefrontal cortex begins very soon after visual 91 cortex, and before perceptual decisions are concluded. We further demonstrate that the timing of 92 evidence accumulation and the direction of flow of information between widespread sensory, motor 93 and association cortices differ between Beta (13-30Hz) and Gamma (31-90Hz) frequency range. 94 An early sweep of Gamma activity across an occipito-parietal-frontal network precedes the gradual 95 arising of Beta mediated decision signals. 96 97 These signals emerge progressively in a lateralized caudo-rostral cascade unfolding along the 98 dorsal stream. The cascade is mainly driven by a continuous flow of information from posterior 99 visual areas to anterior action control regions. Crucially, the strength of the information flow (as 100 measured by phase-transfer entropy) determines the speed of progression throughout the stages of 101 information processing from perception through action as reflected by a positive relationship 102 between connectivity and both faster model accumulation-rates and shorter reaction-times. This 103 provides an important formal link between behaviour, established models of decision-making, and 104 connectivity measures. Taken together, the results reveal a continuous flow of information

105 transmitted and integrated through a hierarchical network that transforms decision-making from 106 perception to action. 107 108 109 Results 110 111 Uncertainty modulates the speed of decisions 112 Participants performed the task first in a training session where individual motion thresholds were 113 estimated for both low and high action uncertainty levels (Fig. 3a). Subsequently, participants 114 performed the task with the motion thresholds that standardized performance, while undergoing 115 MEEG scan.
116 Behavioral performance scaled with levels of perceptual and action uncertainties, confirming the 117 desired effect of task manipulations. During training, participants where slower and less accurate 118 when motion coherence was lower (Fig. 3a). Similarly, during the scan session (Fig. 3b and SI 119 Appendix, Fig. S1) responses were slower under high perceptual (low = 0.77s ±0.1; high = 120 0.88s±0.1; F(1,17) = 158.17 p < 0.0001; post-hoc p < 0.0001; ηp2 = 0.902) and action uncertainty 121 (low = 0.80s ± 0.13; high = 0.85s±0.1; F(1,17) = 6.28 p = 0.022; post-hoc p = 0.022; ηp2 =0.269; 122 2-by-2 repeated measures ANOVA; Tukey-Kramer correction).
123 Participants’ choices were largely independent over trials as indicated by Shannon’s equitability 124 index (mean 0.77 ± 0.016 SD, see SI Appendix and Fig. S2 for statistics) calculated for sequential 125 choice pairs13.
126 Uncertainty modulates the rate of evidence accumulation 127 To decompose the behavioral performance into cognitively relevant latent variables, we fitted 128 accumulation-to-threshold models (Linear Ballistic Accumulator23, LBA), to each participant’s 129 reaction time and accuracy data.
130 Uncertainty can slow responses by reducing the speed of information accumulation (accumulation131 rate), increasing response caution (decision boundary), stretching the time required by perceptual 132 and motor processes not directly related to the decision process (non-decision time), or by a 133 combination thereof. To differentiate these competing mechanisms, we fitted all possible

134 135 Figure 3. Uncertainty modulates reaction times and the speed of decision evidence accumulation. (a) 136 Decision evidence titrated to the participants’ individual motion sensitivity. Reaction times (left panel) and 137 accuracy (right panel) varied with motion strength (grey lines: individual data, black tick lines: mean data). 138 Low and High perceptual uncertainty were estimated at the 75% and 90% accuracy levels, respectively. (b) 139 During the experiment, reaction times were significantly modulated by both perceptual and action uncertainty 140 (aggregated data for uncertainty type, rm-ANOVA on log(RT) ). (c) The task was modelled using a race 141 accumulation model (Linear ballistic accumulator, LBA). Noisy evidence accumulates over time at a rate v 142 up to a decision bound b. The fastest accumulator (thick blue arrow) determines the choice. Non-decision 143 time linked to sensorial and motor processes (t0) sums to the evidence accumulation time to produce reaction144 times. (d) Bayesian model comparison: changes in the sole drift-rate best accounted for the behavioral data. 145 The quality of fit is also seen by the overlap of empirical reaction time distributions for each condition, with 146 data simulated using the winning model. (e) The model predicted faster accumulation of decision evidence 147 when uncertainty is low for both action and perceptual uncertainty (grey lines connects data points from each 148 participant). (f) Model predicted activity was fitted to the power envelope of the MEEG signal in a trial-by149 trial fashion to identify the latencies of accumulators of decision evidence. Non decision time (t0) was 150 decomposed into pre-accumulation (tau1) and post-accumulation (tau2) time reflecting perceptual and motor 151 processes, respectively.

152 combinations of free parameters in a set of 15 LBAs. We compared the goodness-of-fit of each 153 model using random-effects Bayesian model comparison24,25. The model comparison revealed that 154 changes in the accumulation-rate alone (model number 2; Fig. 3d top panel) accounted 155 parsimoniously for the effects of uncertainty on behavior. The goodness-of-fit of the winning model 156 was further confirmed by posterior predictive checks (Fig. 3d bottom panel), performed by 157 simulating data under the winning model and then comparing these to the observed data.
158 In the winning model (henceforth, the LBA model), high uncertainty is associated with 159 comparatively slow accumulation rates. This relationship between uncertainty and accumulation 160 rate held for both perception (z = 3.723, p = 0.00019; Wilkoxon sign rank test) and action (z = 161 3.723, p = 0.00019; Wilkoxon sign rank test) uncertainty, as well as for each subject (Fig. 3e), in 162 accord with previous studies11,14.
163 Non-decision time (t0), encompassing sensory delays and motor execution, was estimated to be 164 370ms on average (see SI Appendix, table S1), which is within the plausible range of non-decision 165 times for humans26.
166 167 Localization of decision-evidence accumulation 168 The temporal evolution of the combined MEG and EEG spectral power (power envelope) from 169 each region of interest (ROI) of the parcellated cortical surface served as the signal for our analysis 170 in beta (13-30Hz) and gamma (31-90Hz) bands. The time onset of evidence accumulation across 171 ROIs was identified by optimizing the split of the non-decision time before and after the 172 accumulation period using Spearman correlation to the single-trial MEEG power envelope (Fig. 173 3f, see Methods and Materials for details, supplemental Fig. S3 for the statistical map). This 174 allows one to depict in space and time the emergence of decision-evidence accumulation.
175 In support of our hypothesis that both increasing and non-increasing activity can mediate evidence 176 accumulation27,28, we found significant (negative) correlations between the LBA model predictions 177 and the MEEG oscillations in beta and gamma bands17 (Fig. 4). Specifically, for both beta and 178 gamma, neural activity after coherence onset desynchronized in a graded fashion and peaked 179 approximately before response suggesting a form of threshold mechanism (Fig. 4a)29,30.
180 In the beta band, desynchronization was strongly modulated by uncertainty in good agreement with 181 our predictions. As the decision unfolds, the accumulated decision-evidence will ramp quickly with

182 low perceptual uncertainty, and slowly with high perceptual uncertainty. Accordingly, 183 desynchronization of beta power-envelopes averaged across trials and ROIs was larger (p < 0.0001, 184 cluster corrected random permutations) for low than high perceptual uncertainty18,29.
185 When a response is chosen between multiple options, the race underlying the selection of each 186 alternative is characterized by an overall larger amount of decision-evidence summed across all he 187 racing accumulators by the time of response13,14. Accordingly, desynchronization of beta power188 envelopes averaged across trials and ROIs was larger for high than low action uncertainty (p < 189 0.0001, cluster corrected random permutations). Gamma power-envelopes, showed a similar trend, 190 but the effects were statistically insignificant.
191 Decision-related dynamics expressed by beta desynchronization were distributed across a wide 192 network (Fig3b, mean across significant ROIs: sign-test z = -3.15 ± 0.48, p = 0.00065 ± 0.0016, 193 FDR corrected) similar to previous EEG reports31.
194 In the gamma band we observed a more localized mosaic of ROIs including contralateral motion 195 sensitive areas (inferior lateral occipital region), bilateral extrastriate areas and bilateral frontal 196 motor regions (comprising premotor areas and supplementary motor area; mean across significant 197 ROIs: sign-test z = -2.27 ± 0.27, p = 0.0058 ± 0.003, FDR corrected).
198 Comparisons between z-transformed correlation values from each of the four levels of our 199 manipulations in isolation confirmed that the quality of fit and results did not vary across trials 200 types (p>0.05, FDR corrected).
201 A continuous flow of information 202 We traced the spectrally resolved temporal evolution of decisions through the visuo-motor 203 hierarchy, finding that decision-evidence accumulation emerges with distinct spatio-temporal 204 profiles between beta and gamma (Fig. 4b). An early wave of accumulation begins at ~120ms from 205 coherence onset within the sparse network oscillating at gamma frequency. It is followed by a 206 second wave mediated by Beta at ~160ms from coherence onset (Fig. 4c; Conjunction of significant 207 ROIs in beta and gamma, median latency across participants, z = 5.53, p<0.0001, Wilkoxon rank 208 test). No difference in latencies was found between hemispheres across frequency bands.

(a) Power plots ranked by reaction-times showing the 213 temporal relationship between signal power envelope (z-scored with regard to each individual‘s baseline 214 average) and reaction times (red curve) at representative ROIs showed separately for Beta band (top row) 215 and gamma band (bottom row). The ordinate of each plot represents individual trials pooled across 216 participants and sorted according to reaction times. The black line indicates motion coherence onset. (b) 217 Latency maps showing the normalized latencies (each accumulation onset time divided by individual non218 decision time) of decision-evidence accumulation across anatomical regions where correlations between 219 power-envelopes and model’s predictions survived random permutation testing (grey areas denote not 220 significant correlation). (c) Decision-evidence accumulation in the gamma band precedes beta (top panel). 221 222 The latency maps (Fig. 4b) show an accumulation gradient towards the precentral gyrus. We fitted 223 a piecewise regression model with a free internal knot to the mean latencies of ROIs located along 224 the dorsal path (Fig. 5a), a critical system for visuomotor decisions32,33. In keeping with our 225 observations the model (Fig. 5b left top-bottom panels) identified the precentral gyrus (comprising

226 primary motor cortex and part of the premotor cortex) as the point of convergence of two linear 227 functions (R2 = 0.734, p < 0.0001) and outperformed a single regression model (piecewise R2 adj = 228 0.681; linear R2 adj = 0.649; adjusted R2 penalizes extra free parameters in favor of simple models).
229 230 Figure 5. A quasi-parallel cascade of decision-evidence accumulation unfolds along the caudo-rostral 231 axis of the dorsal path (a) Regions of interest (ROIs) along the dorsal path color-coded with respect to their 232 position along the caudo-rostral axis (b) Decision-evidence accumulation mediated by beta follows a caudo233 rostral gradient along the dorsal path of the contralateral hemisphere. A piecewise regression (top left panel) 234 best describes the gradient showing that latencies increase from visual areas up to M1 in the precentral gyrus 235 and decrease afterwards suggesting two separate converging flows (Error bars indicate SEM, shaded area 236 covers bootstrapped 95% regression CI). The pattern is inverted for gamma where latencies increase while 237 proceeding from M1 to posterior and anterior ROIs. Despite the differences in latencies along the gradient, 238 the cascade of decision-evidence accumulation is quasi-parallel. The right panels show that the latest ROI in 239 the gradient starts accumulating decision-evidence before the earliest ROI (e.g. V1 for beta) has reached the 240 decision boundary. RT hat is the mean reaction time (across trials and participants) normalized by the mean 241 non-decision time (t0). 242 Interestingly, in the gamma band (Fig. 5b bottom left panel) we found a mirror-symmetric trend 243 with increasing accumulation latencies while proceeding from the precentral gyrus to more 244 posterior and anterior regions (R2 = 0.245, p = 0.042). Thus, accumulation starts with gamma at 245 ~120ms from coherence onset in the precentral gyrus and at ~160ms in the occipital and frontal 246 poles.

247 The onset of the accumulation in beta overlaps with gamma in the occipital pole at ~160ms from 248 coherence onset34. The interval from earliest onset of accumulation to last onset, is only ~100ms 249 and the onset in precentral gyrus is on average ~570ms before a motor response35. The delay from 250 motion onset to the beginning of the accumulation on the occipital pole (~160ms), and the delay 251 from action decision to movement initiation in precentral gyrus (~100ms) are close to the sensory 252 (~200ms) and motor (~80ms) delays measured from neural recordings on macaque11,36. 253 These patterns, albeit with lower spatial resolution, were also found at the sensor level (SI 254 Appendix, Fig. S4). As a note of caution for the piecewise regression, the fit of the LBA model 255 for some of the ROIs within the dorsal path was not significant in the gamma band, reducing the 256 accuracy of their latency estimates. 257 An important observation is that the latest ROIs in the gradient for both beta and gamma starts 258 accumulating decision-evidence before the earliest ROI (e.g. the occipital lobe for beta) has reached 259 its decision boundary (Fig. 5b right top-bottom panels). This suggests that decisions are made on 260 the basis of a continuous flow of information, rather than a serial sequence of discrete decisions.

261 Information flow from perception to action
262 The above analyses identified a flow of information across a widespread visuomotor network. To 263 functionally segregate accumulators sub-serving perceptual and action decisions, and to reveal the 264 influx and efflux of information across them we measured the phase-transfer entropy, a data-driven 265 measure of information flow that is robust to signal leakage22.
266 Fig. 6a shows, for the beta band, the regions modulated by action uncertainty (Action decision 267 regions, pcorrected < 0.0005 in all ROIs) and perceptual uncertainty (Perceptual decision regions, 268 pcorrected < 0.0005 in all ROIs). Action decision regions include ipsilateral cingulate and 269 paracingulate cortex37, contralateral frontopolar cortex, ventromedial cortex, insula, supplementary 270 motor cortex, inferior parietal lobule and medial parietal cortex13,38. Of notice, bilateral precentral 271 gyri were identified as action decision regions which replicates previous findings13,30.
272 Perceptual decision regions in the contralateral hemisphere include posterior areas typically 273 associated with decisions about motion direction. These include lateral occipital cortex (including 274 motion area MT-complex), superior temporal cortex (comprising the superior temporal sulcus) and 275 the superior parietal lobule comprising the superior intraparietal sulcus39 along with the 276 dorsomedial frontal cortex4,40. Interestingly, two areas along the dorsal path on the left hemisphere 277 were sensitive to both perceptual and action uncertainty manipulations (superior frontal gyrus, 278 middle frontal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex superior division (comprising V2 and V3; pcorrected < 279 0.0005 in all ROIs).
280 In the gamma band, we observed bilateral involvement of the superior frontal gyrus41 and inferior 281 frontal gyrus pars triangularis5, along with contralateral frontal medial cortex13 and ipsilateral 282 paracingulate gyrus in action decisions (pcorrected < 0.005 in all ROIs). Perceptual decision areas 283 (pcorrected < 0.0005 in all ROIs) included bilateral superior temporal areas (comprising the superior 284 temporal sulcus39), cuneal cortex, and subcallosal cortex which has been linked to early encoding 285 of confidence for perceptual decisions42.
286 The dominant direction of information transfer between ROIs was estimated using the directed 287 phase-transfer entropy22. The average direction of information flow for each ROI was computed 288 resulting in a single estimate of preferred direction of information flow (either inflow or outflow). 289 Based on these estimates, we calculated a posterior-anterior index22 (PAx) to quantify the direction 290 of flow between caudal and rostral ROIs.

291 Fig. 6b show the smooth global pattern of preferential information flow in the beta range with 292 caudal ROIs preferentially sending information to anterior regions. This pattern is similar to that 293 reported previous work in human resting state22, except that our results show a task-related 294 lateralization, with the contralateral PAx almost twice the size of the ipsilateral one (left: p = 295 0.0001, PAx = 0.357; right: p = 0.0083; PAx = 0.184; left vs right PAx, p<0.0001).

(a) 298 Differences in phase transfer entropy between manipulations of perceptual and action uncertainty for beta 299 (left column) and gamma (right column) allows to define regions accumulating information specific to 300 perception and action decision. (b) Information flow (directional phase transfer entropy) shows a clear rostro301 caudal gradient in beta with MT-complex and the frontal regions being the strongest sender and receiver of 302 information, respectively. (c) Thresholded connectivity plots. Beta activity reflects transmission of 303 information across distant cortical regions mostly within the left hemisphere.

306 It can be seen from Fig. 6b-c that, for beta, the strongest information flow was from the left lateral 307 occipital cortex to the left middle frontal gyrus and the frontopolar cortex. This accords with 308 previous reports of beta-synchronization between primate MT and frontal regions during motion 309 discrimination43. No significant preferential flow from posterior to anterior regions was seen for 310 the gamma range in either hemisphere (left p = 0.79; PAx = 0.05; right p = 0.37; PAx = 0.3) which 311 is expected given the pattern of accumulation latencies observed in gamma but might also reflect 312 the shorter range of gamma interactions44.
313 Integration of behavioral, computational and physiological evidence 314 To highlight the behavioral relevance of the integrated account of visuomotor decision-making, we 315 explored the relationships between connectivity, accumulator model parameters and behavior. To 316 account for multiple-comparisons, we used Holm-Bonferroni correction over eight tests.
317 In the beta range, the caudo-rostral gradient of evidence-accumulation is matched by a gradual 318 transition from perception to action decisions, as shown by a positive correlation between regional 319 specificity to the type of uncertainty and the estimated accumulation latencies (Fig. 7a top left 320 panel, r = 0.27, pcorrected = 0.044, 95%CI [0.079 0.420]). Moreover, the information flow is aligned 321 with the caudo-rostral gradient of accumulation since the flow proceeds from perceptual-decision 322 regions to action-decision regions (Fig. 7a bottom left panel, correlation between regional 323 specificity and direction of information flow: r = -0.37, pcorrected = 0.0016, 95%CI [-0.555 -0.203]).
324 In contrast, for the gamma band we found there was neither significant relationship between region 325 specificity and accumulation latency (Fig. 7a top right panel, r = 0.19, pcorrected = 0.759) nor 326 significant evidence of flow of information from perception to action decision regions (Fig. 7a 327 bottom right panel, r = -0.37, pcorrected = 0.068).
328 Finally, we hypothesized that in a continuous flow of information the amount of information 329 transferred between perceptual and action accumulators co-varies with the rate of accumulation. 330 Faster progression from perception through action should be correlated with phase transfer entropy 331 and model accumulation rate, but negatively with reaction-times.

332 This was the case in the beta range where strong flow was associated with short reaction times 333 (Fig. 7b top left panel, repeated-measures correlation: rrm= -0.378, pcorrected = 0.03, 95%CI [-0.588, 334 -0.12]) and accumulation rates (Fig. 7b bottom left panel, rrm= 0.356, pcorrected = 0.045, 95%CI 335 [0.096, 0.572]). No significant correlation was observed in gamma (Fig. 7b top-bottom right, 336 reaction times vs information flow: rrm= -0.079 pcorrected = 0.564; accumulation-rate vs information 337 flow: rrm = 0.113, pcorrected = 0.816). 338

350 Discussion 351 352 There are two principal results from this study that illuminate the interaction between neural systems 353 for perception and action. First, decisions in regions sensitive to motor precision do not wait until 354 regional sensory decisions are completed. Instead, the accumulation of evidence in motor decisions 355 begins within 100ms after the initiation of evidence accumulation in the early sensory regions. This 356 indicates a continuous flow or cascade of information and its gradual transformation from sensory 357 evidence to motor intention45. Second, the correlates of evidence-accumulation in the beta and gamma 358 frequency ranges have distinct spatiotemporal profiles, and opposite dominant directions of flow. This 359 spectral directionality is predicted by hierarchical cortical networks for prediction and inference in 360 visuomotor control18,46–48. In the beta band, there is not only a spatial gradient in the timing of 361 accumulation-to-threshold between occipital and pre-central cortex, but also a qualitative change in the 362 accumulated signals: from sensitivity to visual uncertainty to sensitivity to response uncertainty. 363 Variability in the strength of the beta-mediated flow of information connecting visual to motor areas, 364 accounts for participants’ decision speed and corresponds to variability in the evidence accumulation 365 rate (Fig. 7b). This relationship points to the strength of information flow as a neurophysiological 366 correlate of the speed of evidence accumulation towards a decision. 367 368 We set out to integrate the analysis of information flow with decision-making implemented by the 369 accumulation of evidence, and assess their joint influence on trial-to-trial variation in behavior (see Fig. 370 1). Independent manipulation of perceptual and action uncertainty was coupled with the decomposition 371 of performance into latent variables in a parsimonious linear ballistic accumulator model23, which 372 accurately generated the response distributions in each task condition including the expected effects of 373 task variance on response latencies11,14. The model predictions of within-trial accumulation were 374 correlated with change in beta and gamma power after the onset of stimulus coherence. Beta 375 desynchronization has been shown to scale with uncertainty30, but here we show its interaction with the 376 temporal evolution of decision making over sub-second intervals. The observed desynchronization 377 displays two signatures of the accumulation-to-threshold class of models: accumulation of decision378 evidence over time and the consistent bound reached shortly before each movement10,29,35. 379 380 Beta and gamma desynchronization are correlated with behavioural performance. For example, in direct 381 recording from non-human primates during working memory49 and sensory discrimination50, the beta 382 band desynchronization was greater for accurate trials compared with inaccurate trials. Such beta power 383 encoding of decision outcomes is supramodal in many cortical areas20. The change in beta power 384 followed the change in gamma power as in the current study: we found an early wave of gamma 385 followed by a second wave of beta.

386 387 Although gamma and beta rhythms have been observed to occur together or in close succession51,52, the 388 temporal relationship is functionally relevant. For hierarchical cortical networks, message passing 389 between regions is a function of the laminar asymmetry of afferent vs. efferent connections46, and the 390 properties of columnar circuitry which preferentially generates gamma rhythms superficially, and lower 391 frequencies from deep layers53,54. This promotes predictive feedback connectivity in beta and lower 392 frequencies, and preferential feedforward ‘error’ signalling in gamma18,48. The beta band’s lower 393 frequency makes it inherently more suitable for coordination of information processing over longer 394 conduction delays33. As seen in Fig. 4, where changes in spectral power were predicted by the LBA 395 model, the latency to accumulation was confirmed as shorter for gamma than beta. Indeed, the spatial 396 distribution of beta latencies in the dominant hemisphere (Fig. 5b) shows a gradient from occipital, to 397 parietal and prefrontal, and lastly motor cortex. The motor cortex is also a region of strong net influx 398 of beta (Fig. 6b), even more than premotor cortex, consistent with the active inference model of motor 399 control18,48. 400 401 The spatial gradient of gamma latencies is reversed, with earliest changes observed in precentral cortex, 402 before occipital cortex, and later gamma latencies in time with beta responses in occipital cortex. This 403 may be because of the difference between predicting when a response may be required and what that 404 response should be55. The sensory stimulus change (visual coherence) in our task is not the result of the 405 participant’s own response, but is predictable a second after the onset of the non-coherent display. The 406 participant can predict when an action is required, but not which actions are permitted or specified. An 407 increase in localized and predominantly short-range interactions in gamma range may therefore be a 408 permissive of information required for the beta-mediated decision between action alternatives56. 409 410 Despite the similar latency of beta and gamma accumulators in occipital cortex, the connectivity 411 analyses indicate distinct routing information at longer and shorter spatial scales, respectively. The 412 pattern of net efflux vs. influx of beta (Fig. 6b) shows a clear division between frontal cortex and 413 posterior lobes. Moreover, the more sensitive a region is to action uncertainty (vs. perceptual 414 uncertainty), the later its onset of beta accumulation, and the greater its bias to inflow (vs. outflow, Fig. 415 7a). In other words, there was a cascade of overlapping accumulators and information flow along a 416 rostro-caudal axis from perceptual to motor regions for beta, at least in the hemisphere contralateral to 417 the response hand. 418 419 Lateralized beta activity during a decision-making task reflects not just movement preparation, but has 420 also been related to a dynamic decision process with updating of a motor plan as a decision 421 evolves29,30,35. The beta power lateralization in motor areas was correlated with the state of decision-

422 evidence. Crucially, these earlier MEG and EEG studies used a fixed-mapping between decisions 423 outcomes and categorical behavioural responses, without choice or independence of perception and 424 action decisions. When this fixed mapping between perceptual decisions outcome and motor responses 425 is removed, sensorimotor beta lateralization disappears57. Our findings complement this work by 426 directly revealing a lateralized progression of evidence accumulation from posterior perceptual regions 427 to anterior motor areas. 428 429 Previous work on visuomotor decisions has often focused on processes occurring at the final choice 430 stage, leaving unresolved the question of whether evidence accumulation is coordinated throughout the 431 cortex or in specific regions. Our findings support a generalized model in which accumulation-to432 threshold provides a canonical mechanism evolving throughout all layers of a visuomotor 433 transformation (Fig. 3a) and suggest that evidence accumulation is not a limited (perceptual) process 434 with a single cortical focus, but is distributed58,59 and applicable to non-sensory evidence or intentions. 435 This multi-focal property of evidence accumulation resonates with results from animal optogenetic58 436 and pharmacological59 studies showing that inactivation of local cortical areas carrying decision-related 437 activity did not affect decision-making performance. 438 439 Taken together, our observations suggest that the beta band response links sensory evidence to motor 440 plans, throughout a widespread network60. We propose that an early neural signalling regarding the 441 need for a response is followed by a second phase that integrates a continuous flow of information to 442 make a decision between them61. In this second phase, decisions unfold on the basis of a continuous 443 flow of information (Fig. 5b), rather than sequential completion of intermediate decisions at the 444 population level. However, this hypothesis refers to the population level, and we cannot exclude the 445 possibility that within each region, a subsection of neurons completes the relevant decision and forwards 446 this outcome to the next level in the hierarchy, while others in that region continue to accumulate. 447 448 The fluctuations in the strength of information flow caused by changes in uncertainty are behaviourally 449 relevant, in their positive correlation with accumulation-rate and negative correlation with reaction 450 times. This establishes an important formal link between behaviour, models of decision-making, and 451 physiological connectivity: Fast accumulating-rates of the linear ballistic accumulator model are 452 associated with a more effective beta-mediated information flow throughout the visuo-motor processing 453 hierarchy, resulting in faster decisions and responses (Fig.7). This link provides a powerful tool to 454 investigate clinical conditions in which the ability to use sensory inputs to guide actions is impaired. 455 Examples include Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Parkinson’s disease and functional movement 456 disorders, which are associated with abnormal evidence accumulation rates62,63, and abnormal beta 457 power64,65.

458 459 In summary, our analytical approach set out in Fig 1 elucidates behavioural decisions through the 460 combination of computational modelling of behaviour and identification of neurophysiological 461 signatures of latent variables, in distributed cortical networks. Beta power reflects the temporal and 462 spatial dynamics of the accumulation and transfer of decision-evidence, with a continuous flow of 463 information between regions rather than sequential discrete decisions. During this flow, the gradual 464 transition from the resolution of sensory uncertainty to the resolution of response uncertainty, enables 465 goal-directed actions in the face of uncertainty.

466 Materials and Methods
467 Participants 468 Twenty healthy volunteers (9 females, 11 males, age range 18-39 years) took part in this study, after 469 providing informed consent. Inclusion criteria included age 18-40 years, right-handed, and screening 470 for neurological or psychiatric illness. Two subjects failed to reach the requisite performance criterion 471 during training and were excluded, leaving 18 subjects in all subsequent behavioral and neural analyses. 472 The chosen sample size was based on previous EEG/MEG studies on perceptual and motor decision473 making35,66. Experimental protocols conformed to the guidelines of the Declarations of Helsinki and 474 were approved by the local research ethics committee.
475 Task and procedures 476 Participants performed a finger-tapping task adapted from previous studies 13,14. Their goal was to 477 detect the onset of coherent motion and to press the button corresponding to one of the downward 478 moving stimuli (coherent stimuli). The number of coherent stimuli defined two trial types: Low action 479 uncertainty trials, where a single coherent stimulus commanded which button to press; and high action 480 uncertainty trials, where three coherent stimuli required the participants to make a simple choice and 481 press any one of the three corresponding buttons (a “fresh choice, regardless of what you have done in 482 previous trials”14). Equal emphasis was placed on the speed and accuracy of the responses. Participants 483 were instructed to fixate on a central red mark throughout the trial. Eye-tracking data collected during 484 the first six scanning sessions confirmed participants were able to successfully perform the task while 485 maintaining fixation (see SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Each trial started with the presentation of the fixation 486 mark and stimuli onset ensued after a variable interval comprised between 0.5sec and 1sec. The imaging 487 session was preceded by one training psychophysical session and one test session scheduled on separate 488 days; the scanning session was conducted a maximum of four days after the psychophysical training, 489 depending on the availability of the participants. The test session was to ensure that the participants 490 were able to perform well under the individually adjusted motion thresholds. In the test and scan 491 sessions, coherence levels were fixed to the individual thresholds corresponding to high and low levels 492 of perceptual uncertainty, the match-to-sample task was removed, and no feedback was provided except 493 for too late or too long responses. Levels of perceptual and action uncertainty where randomly 494 interspersed across trials. Each session consisted of 10 blocks (total 720 trials per participant) separated 495 by a short rest. Trials on which responses were made before 0.1-sec or after 2-sec (on average 1.3% of 496 total trials) were excluded from subsequent analyses.

497 Stimuli 498 Stimuli were presented using Matlab (Matworks, Natiek, MA, USA) and the Psychotoolbox routines in 499 a sound-proof and dimly lit room. For the psychophysical training stimuli were displayed on a CRT 500 monitor at 60cm, and for the scan session stimuli were projected on a screen through a projector at 501 130cm (both with a 60Hz refresh rate) with equivalent pixel resolution of 0.03°.
502 Stimuli were four random dot kinematograms displayed within four circular apertures (4° diameter) 503 positioned along a notional semi-circular arc (3.4° eccentricity) on a black background (100% contrast). 504 200 dots were displayed during each frame and spatially displaced in the next frame to introduce 505 apparent downward motion (6°/sec velocity). To manipulate motion strength (i.e. motion coherence) 506 between trials, on each frame only a certain proportion of dots moved downward whilst the rest of the 507 dots where randomly reallocated. Motion coherence level was kept constant throughout the trial.
508 Since abrupt stimulus onset and offset could elicit large sensory-evoked potentials which might mask 509 decision processes, the 1.5 seconds long coherent motion interval was preceded and followed by 510 intervals of zero-coherence levels lasting 1sec and 0.5sec, respectively.
511 Psychometric calibration 512 Participants were firstly familiarized with the finger-tapping task during a short practice session where 513 100% coherent stimuli were adopted. The familiarization phase was completed when participants 514 reached 90% accuracy across all trial types. In the following psychophysical training, motion 515 coherence was randomly varied between trials to estimate individual motion thresholds. Eight 516 logarithmically spaced motion coherence levels (0 0.5 0.10….0.9) were used (32 trials per level) 517 following extensive piloting to ensure coverage of a wide range of individual motion sensitivity. Each 518 training session comprised 16 blocks of 32 trials. Feedback was provided for correctness of responses 519 as well as for too early or too late responses (100ms and 2.5s from motion coherence onset, 520 respectively).
521 To ensure that participants perceived all the available options (i.e. coherent stimuli) before committing 522 to a decision, occasionally (p = 0.2) after a correct choice they had to perform a secondary match-to523 sample task: a set of grey discs replaced the stimuli and participants had to report whether their locations 524 matched the location of the previously displayed coherent stimuli. They had to press any button to report 525 a match and withhold any response otherwise. A trial was considered as correct only when both choice 526 and matching were correct. Trials with un-matching responses were discarded and repeated within the 527 session.

528 To tailor the sensory evidence to the participants’ individual motion sensitivity across number of 529 options, the discrimination accuracy of each trial type in each training session was fitted using a 530 maximum likelihood method, with a Log-Quick function defined as

531 !"# = 1 − 2$%&!(#$%) ,

(1)

532 where α is the threshold, β is the slope and x is the coherence level. To obtain the proportion correct for 533 each trial type, the Log-Quick function was scaled by,

534  =  + (1 −  − )!"# ,

(2)

535 where γ is the guess rate and λ is the lapse rate controlling the lower and upper asymptote of the 536 psychometric function, respectively.

537 Individual low and high perceptual uncertainty levels for each trial type were estimated as the 75th and 538 90th percentile of the psychometric functions from the last session. The reason for adopting these 539 thresholds was twofold: firstly, participants need to perceive all the available options before committing 540 to a decision. Secondly, supra-threshold trials are best suited for investigating neural correlates of 541 evidence accumulation 67.

542 MEG and EEG data acquisition and processing
543 An Elekta Neuromag Vectorview System (Helsinki, Finland) simultaneously acquired magnetic fields 544 from 102 magnetometers and 204 paired planar gradiometers, and electrical potential from 70 EEG 545 electrodes (70 Ag-AgCl scalp electrodes in an Easycap - GmbH, Herrsching, Germany - extended 10546 10% system). Additional electrodes provided a nasal reference, a forehead ground, paired horizontal 547 and vertical electro-oculography, electrocardiography and neck electromyography. All data were 548 recorded and digitized continuously at a sample rate of 1kHz and high-pass filtered above 0.01 Hz.
549 Before scanning, head shape, the locations of five evenly distributed head position indicator coils, EEG 550 electrodes location, and the position of three anatomical fiducial points (nasion and left and right pre551 auricular) were recorded using a 3D digitizer (Fastrak Polhemus Inc., Colchester, VA). The initial 552 impedence of all EEG electrodes was optimized to below 10 kΩ, and if this could not be achieved in a 553 particular channel, or if it appeared noisy to visual inspection, it was excluded from further analysis. 554 The 3D position of the head position indicators relative to the MEG sensors was monitored throughout 555 the scan.

556 Environmental noise suppression, motion compensation, and Signal Source Separation for the MEG 557 data was followed by separate independent component analysis for the three sensor types and artifactual 558 components were rejected. For EEG data, components temporally and spatially correlated to eye 559 movements, blinks and cardiac activity were automatically identified with EEGLab’s toolbox ADJUST 560 (Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, University of California San Diego). For MEG data, 561 components were automatically identified that were both significantly temporally correlated with 562 electrooculography and electrocardiography data, and spatially correlated with separately acquired 563 topographies for ocular and cardiac artifacts using in-house Matlab code.
564 The continuous artefact-corrected data were low-pass filtered (cut-off = 100Hz, Butterworth, fourth 565 order), notch filtered between 48 and 52Hz to remove main power supply artifacts, down-sampled to 566 250Hz, and epoched from -1500 to 2500ms relative to motion coherence onset. EEG data were 567 referenced to the average over electrodes.
568 MEG and EEG data were combined before inversion into source space 21 using the Miminum Norm 569 algorithm as implemented by SPM12. Notably, combined MEG and EEG allows a better localization 570 of neural sources than each technique on its own21. The forward model was estimated from each 571 participant’s anatomical T1-weighted MRI image. All conditions were included in the inversion to 572 ensure an unbiased linear mapping. The source images were spatially smoothed using an 8 mm FWHM 573 Gaussian kernel.
574 Accumulator model of perceptual and action decisions 575 We adopted formal models of decision-making to decompose the behavioral performance into 576 cognitively relevant latent variables. We fitted accumulation-to-threshold models (Linear Ballistic 577 Accumulator23, LBA), to each participant’s reaction time and accuracy data. The LBA model of 578 decisions is more tractable than drift-diffusion models for n-way decisions while still remaining 579 physiologically informative68 and has been previously applied to a finger tapping task to model fMRI 580 evidence accumulation13. Instead of adopting a two-stage model, which assumes a discrete serial 581 process between perceptual and action decisions, we opted for a ‘unitary’ model where both perceptual 582 and action uncertainty concur in determining participant’s performance in a given trial. The factorial 583 design of the experiment enabled us to divorce perceptual and action decision processes using 584 connectivity metrics.
585 According to this class of models, each accumulator linearly integrates the decision-evidence (or the 586 intention) over time in favor of one action, and the decision is made when the accumulated activity 587 reaches threshold (see Fig.3c). In our task possible actions correspond to a button press from one of

588 four fingers, each modeled by independent accumulators i Î{1, 2, 3, 4}. When three valid actions are 589 available, three accumulators are engaged with activation starting at levels independently drawn from 590 a uniform distribution [0, c0], and increasing linearly over time with an accumulation rate (v) drawn 591 from an independent normal distribution with mean µi and standard deviation si. A response is triggered 592 once one accumulator wins the ‘race’ and reaches a decision bound (b). When only one action is 593 available, only the accumulator corresponding to the available action is engaged. Predicted reaction 594 time (RT) is given by the duration of the accumulation process for the winning accumulator, plus a 595 constant non-decision time t0 representing the latency associated with stimulus encoding and motor 596 response initiation23.
597 To identify the combinations of free parameters that best accounted for the observed behavioral data 598 we firstly fitted 15 variants (i.e. all possible combinations without repetition) of the LBA. Each variant 599 was characterized by a unique combination of free parameters allowed to vary across trials. The best600 fitting parameters for each model variant were used to calculate the Bayesian Information Criterion 601 (BIC), which penalizes extra free parameters in favor of simpler models. BIC values were then used to 602 compare the goodness-of-fit of each variant using random-effects Bayesian model comparison 24,25. 603 Predictions of decision-related activity were generated from the winning LBA model to locate neural 604 signatures of decisions-evidence accumulation in single-trial analyses of MEEG data.

605 Estimation of expected neural activity
606 We generated predictions of decision-related activity from the LBA model13 to locate neural signatures 607 of decisions-evidence accumulation in single-trial analyses of MEEG data. For multiple options, the 608 LBA model assumes multiple active accumulators, one for each finger option. Let -' be the 609 accumulation rate of the winning option (i.e. the one reaching response threshold b), sampled from the 610 normal distribution (', '( ). Let -)% and -)( be the sampled accumulation rates of the alternative 611 options (i.e. the losers), sampled from normal distributions ()%, )(%), ()(, )((), respectively. If 612 the reaction time of a given trial is RT, the latency of the accumulation process is  − &, such that 613 the expected accumulation of the winning option is:

614

[-']

=

*$+'/( -.$/'

(3)

615 Since the losing accumulators have not reached the threshold by the time of the response RT, the 616 expected values of -)% and -)( are smaller than -'.

622 The sum of the winning and losing accumulation rates gives an estimation of total accumulation 623 activity for single trials. For trials with only one available option, the accumulation activity is 624 determined by the only active accumulator.

625 Dimensionality reduction
626 To improve computational efficiency, reduce multiple comparisons issues while retaining the maximum 627 amount of information69, we reduced the dimensionality of the MEEG data by parcellating the cortical 628 surface into a set of 96 regions of interest (ROIs) defined using the Harvard-Oxford cortical atlas (FSL, 629 FMRIB, Oxford) and by representing the dynamic of each ROI with a single time-course, obtained 630 using principal component analysis70. The reconstructed sources within each ROI were first bandpass631 filtered in either beta (13-30 Hz) or gamma (31-90Hz) frequency bands. The coefficients of the 632 principal component accounting for the majority of the variance of the vertices within each ROI, were 633 then taken as an appropriate representation of source activity for that region. Next, to estimate the power 634 oscillations on a single-trial basis, we extracted frequency-specific signal envelope modulations using 635 a Hilbert transform of the source data from each reconstructed ROI (epochs from 500ms before to 636 1500ms after coherence onset). The Hilbert’s envelope is a convenient measure of how the power of 637 the signal varies over time in the frequency range of interest, and thus particularly suited to capture 638 relatively slow fluctuations associated to the instantaneous accumulation of evidence/intentions. The 639 power estimates of individual participants were down-sampled to 100Hz and normalized by their 640 baseline (from 400ms to 100ms before coherence onset).

641 Single-trial analysis
642 To identify the spatio-temporal profile of decision-related accumulation over the brain we derived 643 model-predicted signals for each trial to compare with neural oscillations in beta and gamma frequency 644 bands. We estimated the maximum lagged absolute Spearman correlation between the model predicted 645 activity and the signal envelope in a trial-by-trial fashion. The lagged correlation was used to optimally 646 split the non-decision time before and after the accumulation period to determine the time delay between 647 the neural signal and the model predictions. The time before accumulation provides a measure of the 648 temporal separation between coherence onset and accumulation onset.

649 If the model prediction x is a lagged version of the neural signal y so that

650 () = ( + &)

(5)

651 Where τ0 is a time delay that can vary from 0ms to the individual non-decision time ( &) with steps of 652 10ms, then the maximum absolute lagged correlation between x and y is defined as

653 67() = max|((), ( − 8))|,

(6)

654 where  = [0, 10, 20 … &].

655 With the peak value of 67() occurring when 8 = & which allows us to determine the time delay. 656 We estimated the largest absolute lagged correlation value for each ROI and individuals by comparing 657 concatenated epochs and model predictions. This choice permits to measure accumulation lags specific 658 to each ROI, under the assumption that they differ across brain regions for each participant. The 659 strength of the Fisher-transformed maximum lagged correlations for each ROI was then quantified (z660 score) using a one-sample sign-test. To provide a conservative estimate of significant correlations 661 between model prediction and neural activity, we repeated the above procedure 10.000 times, each 662 iteration using a different phase-randomized version of the original MEEG signal, to obtain a 663 distribution of correlations under chance. Two-tailed statistical significance was assessed by computing 664 the proportion of absolute values of the distribution of correlations generated by chance exceeding the 665 correlation between model predictions and the original MEEG signal. The resulting p-values were 666 corrected for multiple comparisons (False Discovery Rate) across ROIs and frequency bands.

667 Connectivity analyses 668 To explore the direction of the information flow we employed phase-transfer entropy, a data-driven 669 effective-connectivity measure robust to signal leakage22. The preferred direction of information

670 between ROIs whose activity best matched with model’s predicted activity was estimated using the 671 directed phase-transfer entropy. The analyses focused on regions whose activity significantly fitted the 672 LBA model’s prediction.
673 To identify the ROIs that preferentially accumulated evidence for perception or action decisions, the 674 average information flow (quantified by phase transfer entropy) sent by each ROI was calculated for 675 each subject and condition. The difference of information flow between uncertainty levels for 676 perception and action is compared at the ROI level with a surrogate distribution generated by flipping 677 the condition labels for a random number of participants (10.000 iterations). Since significance was 678 estimated separately for perception and action, the critical value for the FDR correction was halved to 679  = 0.025.
680 To quantify the direction of information flow, we calculated a posterior to anterior index (PAx) as 681 implemented by Hillebrand et al, 2016. A positive PAx indicates preferential flow from posterior 682 regions toward anterior regions. ROIs were split into anterior and posterior region with respect to the 683 central sulcus (see SI Appendix, Table S2). Significance was assessed with permutation testing where 684 the average directional phase-transfer entropies were shuffled across ROIs and PAx was estimated. This 685 procedure was repeated 10.000 times to generate a surrogate distribution of PAx values against which 686 the observed PAx values were tested (p<0.025 to account for multiple comparisons).
687 For the correlations in Fig. 7a, we first confirmed homoscedasticity of our data and then calculated 688 bootstrapped Pearson’s correlations. For the correlations in Fig. 7b we used repeated-measures 689 correlation (as implemented in the rmcorr package in R) which accounts for non-independence among 690 observations due to multiple measurements per participant. The resulting p-values were corrected for 691 multiple comparisons by applying Holm-Bonferroni correction.
692 Hypothesis testing 693 Differences in reaction times were tested with a 2-way repeated measures ANOVA (Low/High 694 Uncertainty x Action/Perception). All other hypothesis tests used non-parametric tests or random 695 permutation methods that do not rely on specific assumptions about the distributions of data values. All 696 tests were evaluated at the p<0.05 level (two-tailed), correcting for multiple comparisons where 697 appropriate.
