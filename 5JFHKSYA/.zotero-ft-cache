SUMMARY
The ability to switch ﬂexibly between aversive and neutral behaviors based on predictive cues relies on learning driven by surprise or errors in outcome prediction. Surprise can occur as absolute value of the error (unsigned error) or its direction (signed errors; positive when something unexpected is delivered and negative when something expected is omitted). Signed and unsigned errors coexist in the brain and were associated with different systems, but how they interact and form across large networks remains vague. We recorded simultaneously in the amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of monkeys performing a reversal aversiveconditioning paradigm and quantiﬁed changes in interregional correlations when contingencies shift. We report that errors exist in different magnitudes and that they differentially develop at millisecond resolution. Our results support a model where unsigned errors ﬁrst develop in the amygdala during successful learning and then propagate into the dACC, where signed errors develop and are distributed back to the amygdala.
INTRODUCTION
Daily life requires behavioral ﬂexibility, and this is crucial when environmental cues become predictive of aversive outcomes and then switch contingencies: an aversive cue becomes neutral, and/or a previously neutral cue becomes predictive of danger. Such associative learning is a ﬂexible process driven by surprise signals—the difference between expected and actual outcome—also known as prediction errors (PEs). Extensive work has suggested two different kinds of PE that can drive learning. In one, the error term poses a directional property, a positive or a negative signed value: positive when something unexpected is delivered and negative when an expected outcome is suddenly omitted (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Schultz et al., 1997; Sutton and Barto, 1998). In the other, the effect on associative strength is driven by the absolute value of the error, regardless of its sign, and correlated only with its magnitude (Pearce and Hall, 1980). This kind of error typically

reﬂects an attention signal that can enhance cues’ associability (Pearce and Mackintosh, 2010; Roesch et al., 2012; Salzman et al., 2007).
Previous work has pointed to the amygdala as a possible source for absolute errors, potentially through its role in attention (Belova et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011; Murray, 2007; Roesch et al., 2010). Nevertheless, careful observation of the activity of single neurons has revealed that some units respond to omission of aversive outcome and other units respond to omission of appetitive outcome, suggesting that the sign of the error can also be represented (Belova et al., 2007). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a role in the computation of different types of errors (Alexander and Brown, 2011; Kennerley et al., 2011; Matsumoto et al., 2007; Rushworth and Behrens, 2008; Seo and Lee, 2007), as well as absolute error and attention (Bryden et al., 2011; Hayden et al., 2011). Whereas most studies focus on one region at a time, and conclusions are drawn based on different paradigms and from different species, these two regions form a two-way dense-projections network that is extensively evolved in the primate (Ghashghaei et al., 2007; Wise, 2008). Moreover, most studies that examined PEs used an appetitive paradigm (or a mixture of appetitive and aversive), yet the dACC-amygdala network is extensively involved in fear learning and its update (Dunsmoor et al., 2007; Hartley et al., 2011; Klavir et al., 2012; Livneh and Paz, 2012a, 2012b; Milad and Quirk, 2012; Paz and Pare, 2013; Schiller and Delgado, 2010; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011), and failure to update might underlie anxiety disorders (Etkin et al., 2011; Pitman et al., 2012; Rauch et al., 2006; Shin and Liberzon, 2010). We therefore asked how PEs transfer across this tight network to underlie successful adaptive aversive learning.
To address this, we recorded simultaneously in the amygdala and dACC (dorsal-BA24) of monkeys performing an aversiveconditioning task and its reversal (Li et al., 2011; Schiller et al., 2008). We used the reversal phase to map responses of single units to types of PEs. We then used this to compare the functional connectivity between these regions on a millisecond resolution and how information travels in the network during successful updating of contingencies.

(a pure tone and a visual fractal, six trials each, interleaved), monkeys associated one stimulus with an air puff to the eye (conditioned stimulus, CS+), and the other stimulus was unpaired (CSÀ) (15 trials each, interleaved; Figure 1A). Then, a reversal phase switched contingencies between the CS+ and the CSÀ (15 trials each). Learning was quantiﬁed as the conditioned response (CR), a preparatory eye blink measured by the total time the eye was closed during the 400 ms following CS offset until 100 ms prior to US delivery (Figure 1B). This revealed no difference during habituation (Figure 1C; CS main effect, F[1, 192] = 0.29, p = 0.6) but that monkeys learned to differentiate by responding more to the CS+ during acquisition (CS main effect, F[1, 194] = 20.14, p < 0.001) and to reverse contingencies and respond more to the other CS during reversal (CS main effect, F[1, 190] = 4.94, p < 0.05). We made sure that reversal was surprising on a daily basis by comparing early versus late sessions (notice also that learning curves were gradual during reversal rather than an immediate switch, Figure 1C), and by including control sessions with more CSsÀ, so that they could not predict which is the new CS+.
Amygdala and dACC Responses Represent PEs We recorded 95 CS-responsive dACC neurons (Figures 1D and 1F; 50 and 45 for monkeys B and L, respectively) and 122 amygdala neurons (Figures 1E and 1G; 67 and 55 for monkeys B and L, respectively). Neurons were considered CS responsive if they had a signiﬁcant change in response to either CS at either phase by comparing ﬁring rates (FRs) in the 1,000 ms after CS offset to the baseline taken from 1,000 ms before CS onset (paired t test over trials, p < 0.05). Each neuron FR was then normalized to its own overall average FR for all further analyses. Cells were mainly recorded in the B/AB (BL/BM) nuclei of the amygdala and in dorsal-BA24 of the dACC (Figures 1F and 1G), as these regions are extensively and bidirectionally connected in the primate (Ghashghaei et al., 2007).
Each neuron was classiﬁed into a PE type. To do so, we calculated two indices for each neuron: one index was based on the neural response to the CS+ that turned into a CSÀ (negative index), and the other index was for the response to the CSÀ that turned into a CS+ (positive index). These indices measure the change in activity for the CS from late learning (average FR from last three trials) to early reversal (average FR from ﬁrst three trials). An index was calculated as (reversal – acquisition)/(reversal + acquisition) and, hence, ranges from À1 to 1, with values of >0, indicating that the neuron ﬁred more during early reversal than during late acquisition, and vice versa for values <0. Therefore, the negative index quantiﬁes negative error (NEr), because it measures changes from predicting an expected puff (late acquisition) to its omission (early reversal), and the positive index measures changes from no outcome to a surprising puff, a positive error (PEr). If a neuron responds similarly to both PEr and NEr (>0 in both indices), it signals unsigned PE (an absolute value); otherwise, it signals signed PE, being either NEr or PEr oriented (Figure S1 available online).
We found that, in both regions, units signaled more of a change from no puff to puff: amygdala, mean of index, 0.18, t(121) = 4.25, p < 0.001 (Figure 2A, upper histogram); dACC,

mean, 0.11, t(94) = 2.31, p < 0.05, t tests (Figure 2B). For a change from puff to no puff, there was homogenous representation in the dACC: mean, À0.07, t(94) = À0.94, p > 0.1 (Figure 2B, right histogram); but there was less representation in the amygdala: mean, À0.13, t(121) = À3.12, p < 0.01 (Figure 2A). Similar results are obtained when comparing the actual number of neurons (Figures 2A and 2B, number and percentage of neurons indicated next to the axes, binomial tests, p < 0.01). These proportions of units remained similar across amygdala and dACC when we used late versus early reversal for computing the indices (Figure S2).
To make sure these changes reﬂect surprise signals and not a response to air puff or its absence, we classiﬁed a neuron as PEr only if it also increased its response to the CS+ during early reversal when compared to the CS+ during late acquisition (a puff index; see Experimental Procedures and different shapes in Figures 2A and 2B; hence, a portion of its increased response can be attributed to surprise) and complementary for NErÀ only if it responded more to the CSÀ during early reversal than to the CSÀ in late acquisition (a no-puff index; hence, the response can be attributed also to surprise and not only to puff absence).
In the amygdala, 29 units were classiﬁed as unsigned error and 31 as signed; of the signed ones, only 3 were NEr and 28 were PEr (Figures 2A and 2C). In the dACC, 23 were unsigned and 26 were signed: 11 NEr and 15 PEr (Figures 2B and 2D). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the proportion of either error type across the two regions (Figure 2E; unsigned: 23.8%/ 24.2% for amygdala/dACC, p = 0.9; signed: 25.4%/27.4%, p = 0.9, chi-square).
Furthermore, differences can occur in the magnitude of the overall signal, rather than in classiﬁcation of neurons. We therefore quantiﬁed the overall percent change in FR. We found, ﬁrst, that amygdala neurons exhibited a larger unsigned signal (Figure 2F, left) (amygdala, 133.53%; dACC, 98.52%); second, that FR changes were larger for NEr in the dACC (Figure 2F, middle) (amygdala, 14.52%; dACC, 103.11%); and ﬁnally, that FR changes were larger for PEr in the amygdala (Figure 2F, right) (amygdala, 261.77%; dACC, 50.58%, t[41] = 2.53, p = 0.02). Notice that PErs quantify preference for negative valence in this aversive set-up (a surprise addition of air puff), potentially explaining the stronger amygdala response. This is also in line with the much higher number of neurons in the amygdala that represent PEr than NEr (28 versus 3, p < 0.01, chi-square). We conclude that, although the amygdala represents signed errors in addition to unsigned (absolute) errors, it is biased toward representation of the surprise addition of aversive information.
Changes in Amygdala-dACC Connectivity Dissociate Successful Learning To examine functional connectivity and how it changes during successful learning, we measured cross-correlations (CCs; Figure 3A) between all simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons from both regions. We were speciﬁcally interested here in the directionality of information transfer and, therefore, calculated the distribution of center of mass (CoM) for all signiﬁcant CCs (n = 229 during habituation, and n = 302 during learning, signiﬁcance tested against shufﬂed CC). We always used the amygdala unit as a reference (time zero) when calculating CCs to allow

easy interpretation and presentation; hence, a positive CoM means that amygdala activity precedes, and a negative CoM means that dACC precedes. We found that the overall baseline distribution of CoMs during the habituation phase was signiﬁcantly shifted to indicate that dACC activity precedes amygdala but became less so during learning (Figure 3B): habituation, À3.71 ± 1.95 ms, t(222) = À3.75, p < 0.001; learning, À0.80 ± 1.06 ms, t(297) = À1.49, p = 0.14. In addition to directionality, we found a major decrease in the variance of the population of CoM, indicating a more precise locking and functional interactions that emerge during learning (Figure 3B, inset), F(222, 297) = 2.50, p < 0.0001. Notice that the common CoM is of few milliseconds, which is indicative of this tight one-synapse network (Ghashghaei et al., 2007).
The focus of this study was to test how directionality of information transfer in this reciprocal network changes as a function of three factors: (1) learning (whether it was successful or not: to do this, we separated sessions in which discrimination was learned signiﬁcantly during reversal [n = 51 days with CR signiﬁcantly different across CS+ and CSÀ, p < 0.05, t test] from sessions in which it was not learned signiﬁcantly [n = 49 nondiscriminating days, p > 0.05]); (2) error type (signed or absolute errors, according to the classiﬁcation in the previous section); and (3) source of the PE (amygdala/dACC: grouping to PE types based on the classiﬁcation of the amygdala neuron in the pair or the dACC neuron [notice that these are not mutually exclusive groups]). We found that the full model that compared CoM across the three factors was signiﬁcant (three-way ANOVA, F [1,175] = 10.8, p < 0.01) and further revealed several speciﬁc functional ﬁndings.
First, amygdala unsigned units precede the dACC, but only during successful learning when compared to nondiscriminating days (3.37 ms versus À4.39 ms, p < 0.01, least signiﬁcant difference [LSD] post hoc tests; Figure 3C, dark blue versus light blue). Second, during successful learning, amygdala unsigned units precede when compared to signed units—where the dACC precedes (3.37 ms versus À1.45 ms, p < 0.05, LSD; Figure 3C, dark blue versus dark red).
Therefore, successful learning is characterized by unsigned amygdala units that precede dACC activity and dACC activity that precedes signed amygdala units. Complementing this, we further found that signed dACC units are preceded by amygdala

activity during successful learning when compared to nondiscriminating sessions (1.48 ms versus À3.7 ms, p = 0.05, LSD; Figure 3D, dark red versus light red). These shifts in CoM for the different conditions are further clariﬁed when normalizing to the baseline delay during habituation (Figure S3).
To summarize these effects, we created contrasts between discriminating (successful learning) and nondiscriminating days in all conditions. This revealed the double dissociation where amygdala precedes for unsigned amygdala units and for signed dACC units (Figure 4A, 7.75 ms and 5.18 ms, leftmost and rightmost bars, p < 0.01, F test). Finally, we contrasted error types only during successful learning sessions, revealing dissociation between amygdala and dACC for unsigned minus signed units (Figure 4B; amygdala led by 4.82 ms and dACC led by 4.19 ms).
Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that, during successful learning only, amygdala unsigned units precede, and might be required for, formation of signed dACC units, and then signed amygdala units are driven by these dACC inputs.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we recorded simultaneously the responses of units in the primate amygdala and the dACC during reversal of aversive conditioning. This allowed a direct comparison of how information about error types travels in this network at a millisecond resolution and how changes in functional connectivity underlie successful learning. We found that both types of surprise signals (absolute and signed) are common in both regions, with differences in the magnitude of the signal. Using functional correlations, we found that activity in dACC leads in baseline conditions and in days when learning was weak. During successful learning, however, unsigned error in the amygdala precedes dACC activity, whereas dACC activity precedes signed errors in the amygdala. Summarizing the ﬁndings, our results suggest a model in which successful discriminative aversive learning requires changes in functional connectivity where attentional signals ﬁrst occur in the amygdala and then propagate into the dACC where signed errors occur; these, in turn, propagate back into the amygdala.
These ﬁndings are relevant from two converging aspects discussed later. The ﬁrst involves ﬂexibility and adaptive aversive learning, and the second involves signals of learning in general.

Figure 1. Behavioral Paradigm and Recording Locations (A) Each session included two new stimuli from different modalities, one auditory and one visual. Each day started with a habituation phase when stimuli are presented without outcome (six trials each, randomly interleaved). This was followed by an acquisition phase when one of the stimuli, the CS+, was followed by an air puff to the eye in a trace-conditioning design. A reversal phase followed in which the CS+ now turned into CSÀ and the CSÀ became the CS+ and was followed by an air puff.

Figure 2. Distribution of PEs in the Amygdala and dACC (A and B) Amygdala (A) and dACC (B) neurons were classiﬁed into PE types based on two indices: positive index (x axis), and negative index (y axis), calculated from comparing activity at the end of acquisition to activity during early reversal, when the two CSs change contingencies. Marginal distributions for each index with ﬁtted Gaussians are shown, and proportions of neurons are mentioned next to them. Additional constraints made sure that these were surprise signals and not only responses to a puff or its absence, comparing CS+ to CS+ and/or CSÀ to CSÀ during early reversal versus late acquisition ([no]-puff indices; see Experimental Procedures for details). Triangles represent units that responded more to the CS+ during reversal than to the CS+ during acquisition (puff index > 0); hence, their response to the CSÀ that turned into CS+ (positive index) is not due only to the puff. Squares represent the same when comparing CSÀ to CSÀ (nopuff index > 0); hence the no-puff index restricts the negative index for surprise signals and not only preference for absence of puff. Diamonds indicate either a puff index > 0 or a no-puff index > 0. Circles are neither (all the rest). The conjunctions result in classiﬁcation to unsigned errors (diamonds in upper right quartile),

Amygdala spikes are at time 0, and raster plots show dACC spikes. (B) Histogram of the CoMs from all signiﬁcant cross-regional CCs. All CCs are calculated so that amygdala spike is at time 0; hence, a positive CoM indicates that the amygdala unit leads, and a negative CoM indicates that the dACC unit leads. CCs were calculated separately during habituation (blue) and during learning (red). In both cases, the dACC activity slightly preceded that of the amygdala, but during learning, the variance of the distributions was signiﬁcantly reduced (inset), suggesting more precise interactions and locking during learning. (C and D) The CoM for all CCs was calculated separately for three categories: successful learning versus nondiscriminating days (dark versus light colors); signed versus unsigned PE (red versus blue); and when the pair is classiﬁed for PE according to the amygdala unit (C) or the dACC unit (D). For each category, shown is the overall averaged CC (with ±SEM shaded) and the corresponding mean of all CoMs in the bars (±SEM). The full three-way model was signiﬁcant. Asterisks indicate signiﬁcant post hoc comparisons. The dotted line indicates the mean directionality (CoM) during habituation, as in (B), where dACC leads by 3.7 ms.

These aspects are tightly linked in our study. Most evidence about error types comes from studies involving appetitive paradigms (reward) (Roesch et al., 2012; Schultz, 2012) or a mixture of aversive and appetitive outcomes (Belova et al., 2007; Joshua et al., 2009; Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009; Paton et al., 2006). Less is known about characterization of error types in single neurons in a purely aversive paradigm.
Concerning the ﬁrst aspect, the amygdala-prefrontal network is implicated in fear conditioning and its expression, and is crucial for the updating of associations. Mainly, this network plays an important role in expression of aversive memories and their extinction (Dunsmoor et al., 2007; Herry et al., 2010; Klavir et al., 2012; Linnman et al., 2012; Pare and Duvarci, 2012; Pitman

et al., 2012; Schultz et al., 2012; Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010), and also in reversal (Chudasama et al., 2012; Morris and Dolan, 2004; Schiller et al., 2008) and cognitive modulation (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Schiller and Delgado, 2010). Moreover, failure to update such memories is linked to abnormal functionality and integrity of the dACC (Milad et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2011), likely through the effect it exerts on the amygdala and other output stations. Hence, the ability to update an aversive memory likely relies on the processing of learning signals in this network and might be linked to the success of behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders (Lee, 2013; Pitman et al., 2012; Salzman and Fusi, 2010).
Much research on adaptive aversive learning focused on extinction of fear memories (Milad and Quirk, 2012). The wealth

signed PErs (triangles in lower right quartile), and signed NErs (squares in upper left quartile). The actual number of classiﬁed neurons is marked within each quartile along with the total number of units. (C and D) FR changes from baseline (shaded blue represent ±SEM) for units of different error types in the two regions: amygdala in (C) and dACC in (D). Each type of PE appears on the quadrant matching its location on the coordinate system corresponding to the PE indices, as in (A) and (B). In each quadrant shown is the change in FR to one CS throughout the whole acquisition and reversal periods (15 trials each). The upper row in each quadrant is for the CS+ that turns into CSÀ during reversal, and the lower is for the CSÀ that turns into a CS+. Change in activity for both is required to classify to PE type; see (A) and (B), Results, and Experimental Procedures). The highlighted gray square represents the period taken to classify the change in activity (last three trials of acquisition and ﬁrst three trials of reversal; only signiﬁcant changes are highlighted). For example, for unsigned/absolute errors, shown in the upper right quartiles, notice that the increase in early reversal is evident for both CSs (upper and lower rows) and is slightly larger in effect magnitude in the amygdala, as shown in (C). See Results for statistics. (E) Percentage of unsigned units in the amygdala and dACC (upper bars) and signed units (lower bars). There was no signiﬁcant difference between the regions. (F) Comparing the magnitude of the change in FR. Shown is the percent change from baseline, in early reversal minus late acquisition, averaged over all relevant units (±SEM).

Contrasts Summarizing the Shifts in CoM for the Different Conditions (A) The difference between discriminating (successful learning) and nondiscriminating days, for both PE types and both regions.

of evidence shows that the medial-prefrontal-cortex (mPFC) can be grossly divided into two zones (Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011): one inhibiting the amygdala during fear extinction—the rat infralimbic cortex (IL), paralleled by the human ventromedial-prefrontal-cortex (vmPFC); and the other supporting fear expression and its learning—the rat prelimbic cortex (PL), which is most likely paralleled by the primate dACC and the region we recorded from here. Here, we used a full reversal paradigm that is required to identify PEs, as extinction alone is not enough because a CS0 value changes only in one direction: from positive to negative. Reversal requires creating a new aversive association in parallel to extinguishing an existing one. There are two reasons to hypothesize that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) would be involved in this paradigm: ﬁrst, because it plays a role in fear acquisition and expression (as for the CSÀ that turns into a CS+); and second, because it was shown to be involved in complex learning and understanding of the task structure, as well as signaling different error types during learning. Therefore, the more complex learning of switching contingencies that occurs during reversal can be processed in the ACC. Indeed, we found that errors in the ACC and its connectivity with the amygdala support successful reversal. However, this opens an interesting question: is there a difference in underlying mechanisms between a CS+ that turns into a CSÀ during extinction, from the same process during reversal? There are two main alternatives: the ﬁrst possibility is, just like extinction, reversal involves new inhibitory learning for the CS+ that turns into CSÀ. This would suggest similar modulation by the rodent IL/ primate vmPFC; and in parallel, the PL/ACC and the amygdala together contribute to learning of the CSÀ that turns into a CS+. The second possibility is that the value is transferred between the two CSs during reversal, without direct inhibition of the amygdala, and the ACC takes a more active role by signaling both types of errors and communicating them into the amygdala. These two options are not mutually exclusive.
There is scarce behavioral evidence showing spontaneous recovery and renewal of the original associations after reversal (Bouton, 1993; Rescorla, 2007). This might suggest that inhibition of the original CS+ memory indeed occurs, and additional

evidence comes from partial similarities in brain activations between extinction and reversal (Schiller and Delgado, 2010; Schiller et al., 2008). Our paradigm and results cannot dissociate the two aforementioned options, but they do show that ACCamygdala connectivity is important for the successful learning of reversal. This might, at face value, support the idea that this network underlies complex learning (Livneh and Paz, 2012a), rather than the independent extinction plus new acquisition possibility. However, a direct study comparing extinction and reversal within the same paradigm is required to determine differences and similarities in network mechanisms at the single-cell level. Moreover, it would be interesting to see if reversal (or other complex learning paradigms) might engage this network more efﬁciently and improve successful updating of the aversive memory in psychopathological conditions.
The second major aspect of this study concerns learning from surprising outcomes more generally (Bouton, 2006; Kamin, 1969), formally deﬁned as PEs. Different models suggest different kinds of teachers. In one class, it is the absolute value of the PE that modulates learning (unsigned error) (Pearce and Hall, 1980): by modulating the amount of attention dedicated to the cues, it modulates their associative strength (associability) (Pearce and Mackintosh, 2010). In another class of models, it is the direction of the error that drives learning (signed error): positive when something unexpected is delivered and negative when something expected is omitted (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Schultz et al., 1997; Sutton and Barto, 1998). Although separate models, recent evidence and theory suggest that the two models coexist in the brain and possibly interact to modulate one another (Esber and Haselgrove, 2011; Le Pelley, 2004; Pearce and Mackintosh, 2010; Roesch et al., 2012). Our results show that the two types of errors, signed and unsigned, indeed coexist in the brain; moreover, they coexist within speciﬁc regions—the amygdala and the ACC. On one hand, this could be evidence that the two models coexist or even compete in parallel in local networks. On the other hand, we show here that the two signals are coupled within millisecond resolution between these two regions, with speciﬁc functional directionality: unsigned amygdala precedes dACC and dACC precedes signed amygdala. These ﬁndings can support an integrated model in which shifts in attention signals coming from the amygdala (Belova et al., 2007; Johansen et al., 2010; Murray, 2007; Roesch et al., 2010; Tye et al., 2010), are used to scale the signed errors that develop in the dACC (Behrens et al., 2007; Courville et al., 2006; Kakade and Dayan, 2002; Preuschoff and Bossaerts, 2007). Our results further agree with the proposal that error signals in the dACC can originate from amygdala inputs (Belova et al., 2008; Roesch et al., 2012), and this applies for attention signals in the dACC (Bryden et al., 2011; Hayden et al., 2011) as well as for other types of errors found in prefrontal regions (Alexander and Brown, 2011; Daw et al., 2005; Matsumoto et al., 2007; Paus, 2001; Rushworth and Behrens, 2008; Seo and Lee, 2007; Wallis and Kennerley, 2011).
One noted difference between the current ﬁndings and recent reports is the existence of widespread signed errors in the amygdala. Single-cell studies in rodents provided evidence that unsigned attention signals are widely represented in the amygdala, with little or fewer signed errors (Roesch et al.,

2010). We suggest that the difference might stem from our use of a purely aversive task, compared to an appetitive paradigm. Such aversive learning might engage the amygdala to a greater extent (Davis and Whalen, 2001), via tight ACC / amygdala projections as found here (that dACC activity precedes signed amygdala units). In other words, it might be that, during aversive learning, signed errors are communicated into the amygdala more than during appetitive paradigms. In addition, a recent imaging study found associability signal (driven by cue-speciﬁc attention, hence, representing more unsigned errors) in the amygdala (Li et al., 2011). Because we found that attention signals appear ﬁrst in the amygdala during successful learning, and with higher overall activity, these factors could inﬂuence the BOLD signal and reconcile the results. Finally, we classiﬁed neurons into PE groups independently of the response magnitude; i.e., a neuron would be classiﬁed similarly if it has a strong response or a mild response, as long as it was in the same direction. This could create a bias if signed errors in the amygdala have weaker overall activity changes, as we indeed found. An analysis that would take into account response strength before classifying a neuron might also explain the differential ﬁndings. Here, however, we wanted to examine the functional interactions between error types and, therefore, included all classiﬁed neurons that can contribute to the overall error type signal originating from a region.
The main strength of this study lies in the ability to measure how these two error signals propagate in the network at a millisecond resolution, by calculating CoM of interregional pairwise CCs. The ﬁnding that the dACC precedes during baseline conditions (habituation) is in accordance with the heavier projections from dACC to amygdala than vice versa (Ghashghaei et al., 2007) and also parallels recent functional studies (E. Likhtik et al., 2011, Soc. Neurosci., conference; Livneh et al., 2012). The fact that dACC continued to precede during learning when it was weak/unsuccessful is further in line with the role of the dACC in general anxiety (Etkin et al., 2011; Pitman et al., 2012) and can support two leading models of anxiety disorders: a failure to update value from danger to safety, as in extinction (Milad and Quirk, 2012), and overgeneralization of fear to similar stimuli, evidenced by weak nondiscriminatory learning here (Dunsmoor and LaBar, 2013; Laufer and Paz, 2012; Lissek, 2012; Resnik et al., 2011).
Overall, our study shows that successful learning and updating of aversive memories requires both types of error signals, with unsigned errors in the amygdala driving dACC activity and vice versa for signed errors. Better understanding of the exact balance between these signals in different behavioral paradigms and over more brain regions would provide a better picture of how and why the updating of information can fail and lead to maladaptive behaviors.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals Two male Macaca fascicularis (4–7 kg) were implanted with a recording chamber (27 3 27 mm) above the right ACC (Broadman 24/32) and the right amygdala, under deep anesthesia and aseptic conditions. All surgical and experimental procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Weizmann Institute Animal Care and Use Committee, following National

Institutes of Health regulations and with accreditation from the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Food, water, and enrichments (e.g., fruits and play instruments) were available ad libitum during the whole period, except before medical procedures.
Behavioral Paradigm During each session, the monkeys engaged in a classical trace conditioning task with a random intertrial interval (ITI) of 25 s on average (Figure 1A). The CS+ of either a new pure tone or a new fractal cue (Chaos Pro 4.0 program; http://www.chaospro.de) was paired with an aversive US of an air puff (150 ms duration; three to ﬁve bars; located proximally 5 cm from the left eye). Each CS was presented for 2 s, followed by a trace period of 0.5 s and then delivery of the US. The stimulus of the other modality was presented without being followed by any outcome (CSÀ). Hence, in each session, there was an auditory or a visual CS+ (in randomly interleaved days) and a CSÀ of the other modality.
Each new session started with a habituation stage, in which the two CSs were presented randomly (six trials each), followed by the acquisition stage described earlier (15 trials per each CS, randomly interleaved) and a reversal stage, in which the CSs switched value, with the CSÀ becoming a CS+ (followed by the US) and the CS+ becoming a CSÀ (presented without US) (15 trials each).
There were 96 sessions overall that included full acquisition and reversal, 49 in monkey B and 47 in monkey L.
Behavior CR was quantiﬁed as the anticipatory eye blinks, measured as the total time the eye was closed during the 400 ms starting from CS offset to 100 ms prior to US delivery (Figure 1B).
A digital video camera for dark (infrared) conditions (Provision-ISR) recorded the monkey’s left eye at 50 Hz. Video analyses was performed semiautomatically using custom-made software implemented in Matlab to identify periods when the animal closed the eye. In short, the minimal rectangle surrounding the eye was deﬁned by the experimenter for each session, and few typical ‘‘closed’’ states and few typical ‘‘open’’ states were identiﬁed. The software then quantiﬁed the distribution of pixels’ light intensity for each state and then calculated the Jensen-Shannon divergence for each frame, resulting in a probability of being in a closed state and a probability of being in an open state. A threshold for both probabilities resulted in a per-frame classiﬁcation. We validated the algorithm by random samples of days and found it to be consistent with the judgments of a blind human observer for >95% of the reported eye blinks.
Each day was sorted using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, comparing the CR from the two CSs during reversal. Discirminating days were deﬁned as days in which the monkey signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) differentiated between the two CSs in last seven trials (per CS) of reversal training. Nondiscriminating days were deﬁned as all other days.
It could be argued that monkeys could learn that reversal occurs daily and predict it. However, it is probably impossible for the animal to estimate when exactly this would happen, because there were 30 trials during acquisition with variable ITI, and we doubt that the animal can count it. To assure this, we separated early sessions from late sessions and tested whether behavior was similar at the end of acquisition and at early reversal. There was no difference in differentiation of CSs at early reversal in early sessions versus late sessions (p > 0.1, t test), indicating that the reversal came as a surprise. In addition, we repeated the paradigm in sessions in which two additional CSsÀ (one of each modality) were used (Klavir et al., 2012); hence, the animal could not know which CSÀ would reverse to be a CS+. There was no difference in learning behavior in these days. Notice also the gradual learning curves in Figure 1, showing that real learning occurred. In summary, although we repeated the paradigm for several sessions in each animal, early reversal was a surprise, as also reﬂected in the neural activity. Finally, we used completely new stimuli each day (different fractals and different pure tones).
MRI-Based Electrode Positioning Anatomical MRI scans were acquired before, during, and after the recording period. Images were acquired on a 3-Tesla MRI scanner: (MAGNETOM Trio,

Siemens) with a CP knee coil (Siemens). A T1-weighted, three-dimensional gradient-echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence was acquired with a repetition time of 2,500 ms, an inversion time of 1,100 ms, an echo time of 3.36 ms, an 8 ﬂip angle, and two averages. Images were acquired in the sagittal plane, 192 3 192 matrix, and 0.63 mm resolution. A ﬁrst scan was performed before surgery and used to align and reﬁne anatomical maps for each individual animal (relative location of the dACC, amygdala, and anatomical markers such as the interaural line and the anterior commissure; conﬁrmed using atlas (Martin and Bowden, 2000; Saleem and Logothetis, 2007). We used this scan to guide the positioning of the chamber on the skull at the surgery. After surgery, we performed another scan with two electrodes directed toward the dACC and the amygdala, and two to three observers separately inspected the images and calculated the regions’ anterior-posterior and lateral-medial borders relative to the electrodes. The depth of the two regions was calculated from the dura surface.
Recordings The monkeys were seated in a dark room and each day, up to six microelectrodes (0.6–1.2 MU glass/narylene coated tungsten, Alpha Omega or wesense) were lowered inside a metal guide (Gauge 25xxtw, OD: 0.51 mm, ID: 0.41 mm, Cadence) into the brain using a head-tower and electrode-positioning-system (Alpha-Omega). The guide was lowered to penetrate and cross the dura and stopped once in the cortex. The electrodes were then moved independently further into either the dACC or the amygdala (we performed four to seven mapping sessions in each animal by moving slowly and identifying electrophysiological markers of ﬁring properties tracking the known anatomical pathway into the dACC and amygdala). Electrode signals were preampliﬁed, 0.3 Hz–6 KHz band-pass ﬁltered, and sampled at 25 Khz; and online spike sorting was performed using a template-based algorithm (Alpha Lab Pro, Alpha Omega). We allowed 30 min for the tissue and signal to stabilize before starting acquisition and behavioral protocol. At the end of the recording period, ofﬂine spike sorting was further performed for all sessions to improve unit isolation (ofﬂine sorter, Plexon).

are followed by an air puff) and a no-puff index similarly deﬁned on the response to CSÀ in early reversal compared to the response to CSÀ in late acquisition. For the PEr, we required a puff index > 0 to assure that it is not merely a response to the air puff. In other words, to have a PEr, it is not enough that a neuron responds more to the CS+ compared to when it was a CSÀ, but it also has to respond to the puff more than before; therefore, at least some component of its increased response is due to the surprise. For NEr, we required that a no-puff index > 0, hence some of the neuron response is related to surprise and not only to the absence of a puff. For unsigned error, we required that either index (puff or no puff) be > 0; hence, some component of the neural response is due to surprise for a CS.
The remaining units were not assigned. It could be argued that units with a positive index and negative index < 0 are also unsigned inhibition. We made sure that it did not change the major ﬁndings in any way and preferred to avoid treating them here. CCs For each pair of amygdala-dACC units that were recorded simultaneously (i.e., during the same session), standard CCs were calculated in windows of À500 to 500 ms around each amygdala spike and in 25 ms bins. Shufﬂing technique was used to assess statistical signiﬁcance: we shufﬂed the order of the trials 40 times and computed CC at the shufﬂed condition. CCs that included clusters of bins that exceeded 95% of the shufﬂed distribution were identiﬁed as signiﬁcant.
For each CC, a CoM was computed as follows:
PðFRi ÃTi Þ PðFRiÞ :
All results concerning behavior were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA with eye blink width as dependent variable, Signiﬁcant interactions were followed by post hoc LSD comparisons, and for all comparisons, significance was assumed at p < 0.05, unless reported speciﬁcally.

Data Analyses Response FR was computed as the average FR in the 1,000 ms from CS offset. The response therefore includes all of the Trace interval and the immediate response to US delivery, as in previous relevant studies (Belova et al., 2007; Calu et al., 2010; Roesch et al., 2010). Responsive units were deﬁned by comparing this FR to the baseline taken 1,000 ms prior to CS onset, using a paired t test. The response FR was then normalized to the average FR during the learning phase and used for all subsequent analyses. PE Groups To sort the units into PE groups, the average FR change was calculated for each CS in the last three trials of acquisition and in the ﬁrst three trials of reversal. Error indices were calculated as follows:

providing a measure ranging from À1 to 1. This index was calculated twice, once for each CS. The NEr index was calculated for the CS that turned from positive to negative; i.e., the air puff previously following the CS is now omitted for the same CS, hence, a NEr. The PEr index was deﬁned for the CS that turned from negative to positive; i.e., the previously neutral ‘‘safe’’ CS is now followed by an air puff, hence, a PEr.
Units were then classiﬁed as follows:
(1) Unsigned PE: positive index > 0 and negative index > 0. (2) Signed PE: d NEr: negative index > 0 and positive index < 0. d PEr: negative index < 0 and positive index > 0.
However, note that some neurons could simply be responding more to the addition of an air puff independent of surprise, or even to its absence independent of surprise. Hence, we applied an additional constraint and calculated a puff index, deﬁned by the response to CS+ in early reversal compared to the response to CS+ in late acquisition (i.e., the two different CSs but when both
