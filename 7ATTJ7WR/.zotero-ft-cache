Abstract
Robotmanipulators are designedto perform tasks which would otherwise be executedby a human operator. No manipulator can even approachthe speedand accuracy with which humans execute these tasks. But manipulators have the capability to exceed human ability in one particular area; strength. Through any reasonable observation and experience, the human's ability to perform a variety of physical tasks is limited not by his1 intelligence, but by his physical strength. If, in the appropriate environment, we can more closelyintegrate the mechanical power of a machine with intellectually driven human hand under the supervisory control of the human's intellect, we will then have a system which is superior to a loosely-integrated combination of a human and his fully automated robot as in the present day robotic systems. We must therefore developa fundamental approach to the problem of this "extending" human mechanical power in certain environments. "Extenders" will be a class of robots worn by humans to increase human mechanical ability, while the wearer's intellect remains the central intelligent control system for manipulating the extender. The human body, in physical contact with the extender, exchanges information si~als and Dower with the extender.
Commandsare transferred to the extendervia the contactforcesbetweenthe wearer and the extender as opposedto use of joystick (master arm), push-button or key-board to execute such commandsthat were used in previous man amplifiers. Instead, the operator becomesan integral part of the extenderwhile executingthe task. In this unique configuration the mechanical power transfer between the human and extender occurs in addition to information signal transfer. When the wearer usesthe extenderto touch and manipulate an object,the extendertransfers to the wearer's hand, in feedbackfashion, a scaled-downvalue of the actual external load which the extender is manipulating. This natural feedbackforce on the wearer's hand allows him to "feel".the
scaled-downvalue of the external forces in the manipulations. Extenders can be utilized to maneuver very heavy loads in factories, shipyards, airports, and construction sites. In some instances, for example, extenders can replace forklifts. This article describes the experimental results for a prototype extender2.
1. Introduction Manipulators have the potential to exceedhuman ability in one particular area, strength.
The ability of a human to lift heavy objects is determined by his own muscular strength. The ability of a robot manipulator to perform the same tasks depends upon the available actuator torque. A relatively small hydraulic actuator can supply a large torque. In contrast, the muscular strength of the average human is quite limited. Extenders will be a class of robot manipulators which will extend the strength of the human arm, while maintaining human control of the task. The extender is distinguished from conventionalmaster-slave3 systems;the extenderis worn by
1 The pronouns "he" and "his" are used throughout this article are not meant to be gender-specific. 2 For the general analysis on extender dynamics and control, contact H. Kazerooni at the above
address. 3 A master-slave system (tele-operator system)uses a control joystick of similar geometry to the manipulator for input. The joystick has position transducers at the joints to measure displacement,and the output from thesetransducersis usedas an input to the manipulator. Thus the motion of the manipulator follows that of the joystick. The joystick is called the master

the human for the purpose of direct transfer of power. Consequently, there is actual physical contact betweenthe extenderand the human, allowing transfer of mechanicalpower in addition to

information signals4. Becauseof this unique interface, control of the extender trajectory can be

accomplished without any type of joystick, keyboard, or master-slave system. The human

provides an intelligent control system to the extender, while the actuators ensure most of the

necessarystrength to perform the task. The key point is the conceptof "transmission of power and information signals". The human becomes a part of the extender, and "feels" some scaled

version of the load that the extender is carrying. In contrast, in a conventional master-slave

system,the human operatormaybe either at a remotelocation or closeto the slavemanipulator, but

he is not in direct physical contact with the slave in the sense of transfer of power. Thus the operator can exchangeinformation signals with the slave, but mechanicalpower is n.Q.et xchanged

directly. In a typical master-slave system, natural force reflection does not occur because the

human and the slave manipulator are not in direct physical contact. Instead, a separate set of

actuators are required onthe master to reflectforcesfelt by the slavebackto the human operator5. In the extendersystem,the input to the extenderwill bederived from the set of contactforces

resulting from the contactbetweenthe extenderand the human. This set of contactforcesis being

used to manipulate an object in addition to generating information signals for the extender

control. Note that force reflection occurs naturally in the extender, the human arm will feel a scaled down version of the actual forces on the extender without a separate set of actuators. For

example, if an extenderis usedto manipulate a 100 lbf object,the human may feel 10 lbf while the

extender will take the rest of the load. The 10 lbf contactforce is used not only for manipulation of

the object,but also for generatingthe appropriatesignals to the extendercontroller. In other words, the contactforce between the human and the extenderis measured,appropriately modified (in the

sense of control theory to satisfy the performance and stability), and used as an input to the

extender control, in addition to being used for actual maneuvering. A simple example is given in Figure 1a to show some fundamental concepts about the

extender. Figure 1a showsa one degreeof freedomextender, moving a load. If the load weight is

W, at equilibrium, the following equality is true for the extender.(Figure 1b)

'C + fe h -W l

(1)

where 'Cis the actuator torque and feis the forceimposedby the human onthe extender. The goalis

to developa control algorithm in the system such that f eh is always a constant portion of 'C. In

other words, the human always feels a scaleddown version of the actual necessaryforce to lift the

load. Supposethe load weighs 100 pounds, while l-2' and h-1', it is then desired to control the

extender such that fe-10 lbf, for example, while 'C-190 lbf.ft. Note that the 10 lbf on the

extender, imposed by human, is the amount of force that is used to help lifting the load. The

human will feel this 10 lbf as a reaction force (toward down in Figure 1). The human uses this force as a natural reflection to feel the scaled down version of the actual force. If the system is

accelerating, the total load in lifting W with acceleration of V e and velocity of ve is [W l

manipulator, and the mechanical manipulator is called the slave. Ideally, the motion of the slave
will be identical to that of the master. 4The human-machine interaction in active systems has been traditionally characterized by the exchange of "information signals" only. For example in human-computer interaction, the human sends information signals to the computer via a keyboard. In another example, a car driver sends an information signal to the engine by pushing the accelerator. There is no power transformation betweenthe driver and the car; the driver doesnot feel the load onthe car. 5 The elimination of force feedback in remote master-slave manipulation may result in pQor
positioning precision and possible instability [18, 25].

2. History and Backe-round The extenderemploysa direct physical contactbetweenthe human and the manipulator for
the purpose of accepting power and information signals. The conceptof a device to increase the strength of a human operator using a master-slave systemhas existed since the early 1960s. The concept was originally given the name "man-amplifier". The man amplifier was defined as a type of manipulator which has the effect of greatly increasing the strength of a human operator, while maintaining human supervisory control of the manipulator. Note that previous systems were designedbaseduponthe master-slaveconcept,rather than the direct physical contactbetween human and manipulator for the purposeof powerand information signals[4, 8,9,10,11,17,20,212, 2].
Figure 1: a: One degree of freedom (dof) experimental extender. b:The free body diagram of the extender. c: The experimental one dot extender at the University of Minnesota. This experimental extender is made of steel (160 Ibf) to simulate the load. In contrast with the Hardiman and other man amplifiers, the extender is not a master-
slave system. There is no joystick or master device for information transfer. Instead, the human operators commands to the extender are taken directly from the interaction force between the human and the extender. This interaction force is also used to help the extender manipulate an object. In other words, the power and information signals transfer simultaneously at one point. The controller developedfor the extendertranslates the signals representing the interaction force signals into a motion command for the extender. This allows the human to initiate tracking commandsto the extender in a very natural way6.
6 A point must be made about what we mean by "natural way". If "talking" is defined as a natural method of communication between two people, then we would like to communicate with a computer by talking rather than using a keyboard. The same is true here; if we define "maneuvering the hands" as a natural method of moving loads, then we would like to only move our hands to maneuver a load, as opposed to using any keyboard or joystick.

Some of the major areas of application for the extender might include manufacturing, construction, loading and unloading aircraft, maneuvering cargo in shipyards, foundries, mining or any situation which requires precise and complex movement of heavy objects. Two main categories of manipulation have been defined for the extender: constrained and unconstrained. In unconstrained maneuvers, the extender is free to move in all directions
without any interaction with another system. On a factory floor where heavy objects need to be moved about, the extender could be worn by a worker who would then have the ability to lift and
carry these objects. This would be an example of unconstrained maneuvering. Currently, heavy pieces may be moved about by forklifts, pulleys, cranes or similar equipment. The extender will offer an advantage overthese methodsbecauseit is designedto follow the human arm motions in a very "natural" way. The human will be able to manipulate heavy objectsmore easily without the use of any key board, joy stick or pushbutton. It is expectedthat the human operator will be able to maneuver heavy loads with greater dexterity, speed,and precision. In comparison with existing systems such as forklifts, pulleys, and cranes, the extender offers the human the opportunity to adjust the orientation of objects.F~re 2 showsthe schematicof the architecture for a prototype multi-dof extender being built at the University of Minnesota. This type of motion may be required for manipulating cargo in a shipyard, assemblytasks, or in a construction application suchas installing large windows. The extenderis shownwithout a base for clarity. In reality, the extender might be attached to a mobile or stationary base. Also note that the sleeveinto which the
human's arm would be inserted is eliminated in the interest of clarity. The secondcategory of manipulation with the extenderis constrained manipulation. This
type of manipulation includes any movement which requires interaction with a third object, the "environment". Examples of constrained manipulation by the extender might include operation
of a pneumatic jack, bending of materials, or press fitting.

The extenderalsohas the potential to becomea useful upper limb orthosis for the physically impaired. An orthosis is an externally applied device which improves the functionality of an
impaired limb7. The main purpose of an orthosis is to enhancethe functionality of existing body segments; in contrast with a prosthesis, which servesto replace body segments [2,3,5,23, and 24].
The extender would be classified as an orthosis, rather than a prosthesis, becauseit would enhance existing motor ability instead of replacing an absent segment. The extender would
augment the lifting ability of the patient and also allow continued use of the patient's remaining motor ability. For a patient to employ the extender, he must have some ability to move his arm.

7Appropriate modification of the extenderfor this use would include decreasingthe overall size of the extender, decreasingthe size of the actuators used, and improving the cosmeticappearanceof the extender. Recent discoveries in superconductivity may lead to design and construction of
electric motors with high powerto weight ratio so they can beemployedto powerthe extender.

~\

The capability for somemotion is necessarybecausethe extenderrequires motion from the user in order to move. Thus, the patient must use his remaining muscle ability to drive the extender. The extender would serve to improve the patient's limb function while utilizing the remaining natural limb function.
3. ExDerimental Extender
To understand the issues in control and dynamics involved in human/machine interaction, the control of an experimental one dof extender is described (Figure 1c). The general building blocks on nonlinear dynamics and control (in particular the stability of the human and extender taken as a whole) are given in references 7 and 11. Figure 3 shows the schematic of the control loop for a one dof experimental extender. Two forces add up to maneuver the extender: f 8 and 'C. The contact force between the human and the extender, fe, is the result of human intention to move up the extender and the actuator torque, 'C, is the result of the feedback. A velocity controller is chosen as the lowest level of control for the extender so the extender is stabilized independently of the human dynamic behaviorS.

The interaction force between the human and the extender is simply fed back and used (after passing through the compensator, H) as an input to the velocity controlled extender. When the human pushes against the extender, the contact force, fe, is measured and passed through the
compensator, H. The output of this compensatoris used as the input command for the velocity controlled actuators of the extender. When the human does not push against the extender, the contactforce, fe, and consequentlythe input commandto the actuator are zero. The zero command
for the velocity controlled actuators results in zero speedfor the extender. In other words, when there is no push from the human, the extender will be stationary. H is of paramount importance in the stability of the systemof the human and the extendertaken as a whole9. For a given load, it is desirableto have the bandwidth of the extenderwide soit can keepup with the high speedmotion of the human arm. It is also desirable to have the contact force remain as small as possible so one

can maneuver a large load with a small contactforce10. It has been shownin [7] and [11] that in order to achieve a fast responseand a small (but nonzero)contactforce oneneedslarge values for H. However, one cannot choosean arbitrarily large value for H; the stability of the system must also be guaranteed. References 7 and 11 describe the instability via a formal mathematical framework. Here it is explained how instability may occur in the system when a large value for H
is chosen. Suppose the compensatorHhas a large gain11 overa frequencyrange of operation. If the human decidesto moveup the object,the extenderwill move up with sucha large velocity that it pulls the human arm up. This reversesthe direction of the contactforce betweenthe human and the extender (downward in Figure 3). Then the extenderrespondsto the downward force with a large velocity which will pull down the human arm. This periodic motion occurs in a very short amount of time and the motion of the extenderwill becomeoscillatory and unbounded. H must be designed such that its gain is large enough for the human to maneuver an object with high speedwhile stability is guaranteed.
First, the dynamic behavior of the experimental1 dof extenderand its velocity controller12 is given here. An explanation of how one additional force feedback passing through a compensatorallowing for a stable interaction will follow. The prototype extenderis poweredby an EXCELLO SS-8-100limited rotation hydraulic actuator (1000total rotation, 1800 ft.lbf maximum
torque at 3000 psi). A MOOG 72-102 2-stageservovalvehas beenused to drive the actuator. The servovalve has the rated flow of 40 GPM at 1000 psi, with 0.02 Amps of the input current. The dynamic behavior of a servo hydraulic actuator is governed by equations 3-5. Equation 3 is thp valve dynamics while equations 4 and 5 representthe flow continuity and actuator dynamics [19].

represent the gain. 12 The nature of the velocity controller is not of importance in this analysis. One can always use a number of advanced nonlinear control methodologies for the development of robust velocity controllers for robotic applications [26, 27]. In the simplest case, one can design a velocity controller for eachdegreeof freedom of the extenderindependently, while satisfying the extender closed loop stability.

~= 90 rad/sec, ~ =100 rad/sec, and Ko=1.6 allow for the widest bandwidth for the closed loop
velocity control. This bandwidth is limited by the high frequency unmodeled dynamics in the system [12,13, and 14]. The experimental and theoretical dimensionless closed loop frequency responseplots (figure 6) showa bandwidth of approximately10 rad/sec(1.7hertz).
The next level of control involves the design of a compensatorthat operates on the contact force between the extender and the human. The emphasis of the human arm model is on the functional relationship between the dynamic input and output properties of the human arm. Therefore, there is less concernabout the internal structure of the componentsin the model. The particular dynamics of nerve conduction, muscle contraction and central nervous system processing are implicitly accounted for in constructing the dynamic model of the human arm. With regard to the above assumption two variables affect the human arm trajectory: 1) the commanded trajectory issued from the human central nervous system, lit), and 2) the external force on the human arm imposed by the extender, fh. The integration of the abovetwo dynamical
properties results in the dynamic equations of the human arm.

the Closed Loop Velocity Dynamic Behavior

Whenever a force is applied to the human arm, the end-point of the human arm will move in response. The sensitivity function ~, is defined as a mapping from the imposedforces, fh, on the hand to the resulting displacementof the human hand. In the simplest case,one can think of ~ as the reciprocal of the hand muscles. Ghrepresents the mapping from commandedtrajectory issued from the human central nervous systemto the human hand position, Yh' ~ and ~ are generally nonlinear mappings, however in this example they can be considered as transfer functions that map Ut)and fhto Yh. Figure 7 showsthe basic structure for the closedloop control systemof the one dof experimental extender. Erepresentsthe physical complianceof the human arm flesh and the force sensorwhich is located betweenthe human arm and the extender. Since the force sensoris very stiff, E will be dominated by the physical compliance of the flesh. Force sensor amplifier gain, Kf. translates the contactforceto a voltage, which is then fed into the computer. The transfer function for the position of the extenderis as follows:

From equation II, tlle larger H is chosen to be, the closer Ye will be to ~l1I and in tlle limit when H-+oo then Ye-+GhUh(the extender will follow the human command perfectly). However one

cannot choose an arbitrarily large value for H; stability of the system in Figure 7 must also be

guaranteed. Raising the gain of H will increase the extender closed loop bandwidth until a point is reached where the extender can no longer be operated in a stable manner. The linear stability

condition is given by inequality 12. If one guarantees the condition14, then the system will remain stable, however if one does not satisfy inequality 12, no conclusion can be made. On the other hand, if the system is unstable, then inequality 12 must have been violated.

The above stability condition does not directly depend on the internal structure of the variables;

one can use various transfer functions for Ge,Shor E with different orders in inequality 12. The

compensator, H, was chosen as a first order filter in order to reject high frequency components of the command signal which could adversely affect system stability and performance.

Since inequality 12 is only a sufficient condition for stability, violation of thus condition does not

lead to any conclusion. It was observed experimentally that the closed loop system remains stable for all Kh< 0.6. Figures 8 and 9 show two stable cases where the extender velocity, Ve, is

proportional with the extender input, Ue. (Ueis plotted with the velocity unit as Ue/KtKad; this

allows for dimensionless ratio for these two variables which is consistent with the plot of Figure 6.)

Figure 10 shows an experiment with Kh- 1.7 where the system becomes unstable and oscillates.

14 The stability of the system is analyzed by two methods in reference 7. First, the Small Gain
Theorem is used to determine a sufficient condition for stability in a completely general, unstructured, nonlinear system. Then, a frequency domain sufficient condition for stability of the linear, time invariant model is determined in. The condition for stability is determined using the multivariable Nyquist Criterion, with the "size" of the operators evaluated in terms of singular values. The stability criteria in both cases is expressed in terms of size of H in comparisonwith the size of other operators in the loop. It is also shownthat the stability condition for linear systems is a sub-classof condition derived by Small Gain Theorem.

-""o~~o

Since the experimental extender is a linear one dimensional system, the exact stability can be examined by observing the root locus of the closed loop system. The root locus approaches the imaginary axis as the compensator gain Kh approaches unity. Thus, the root locus analysis predicts stable operation for ~ <1 while the system experimental1y exhibits stable maneuver for Kh<.6. The stability condition expressed by inequality 12 is a sufficient condition only and it
cannot predict instability. Examining inequality 12 leads to a smal1er value for ~ to guarantee the stability, than the one offered by. root locus. Although the stability criterion expressed by inequality 12 leads to a more conservative stability condition, it does not depend on the internal structure of the extender and human arm models.

4. Summary and Conclusion This paper has presented the concept of the extender, which is a manipulator to amplify the
strength of a human. Extenders are distinguished from conventional man amplifiers due to their exchange of power and information signals when interacting with the human. The instability of such interaction between the human and extender has been addressed. A hydraulic experimental single degree of freedom extender has been built and tested to verify the control and stability criterion addressed in Part II. A multi degree of freedom extender is being built at the University of Minnesota for research work on the extender constrained maneuvers.
