23	   Abstract
24	   Human behavior is strongly driven by the pursuit of rewards. In daily life, however, benefits 25	   mostly come at a cost, often requiring that effort be exerted in order to obtain potential benefits. 26	   Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are frequently 27	   implicated in the expectation of effortful control, showing increased activity as a function of 28	   predicted task difficulty. Such activity partially overlaps with expectation of reward, and has 29	   been observed both during decision-making and during task preparation. Recently, novel 30	   computational frameworks have been developed to explain activity in these regions during 31	   cognitive control, based on the principle of prediction and prediction error (PRO model, 32	   Alexander and Brown, 2011, HER Model, Alexander and Brown, 2015). Despite the broad 33	   explanatory power of these models, it is not clear whether they can also accommodate effects 34	   related to the expectation of effort observed in MPFC and DLPFC. Here, we propose a 35	   translation of these computational frameworks to the domain of effort-based behavior. First, we 36	   discuss how the PRO model, based on prediction error, can explain effort-related activity in 37	   MPFC, by reframing effort-based behavior in a predictive context. We propose that MPFC 38	   activity reflects monitoring of motivationally relevant variables (such as effort and reward), by 39	   coding expectations, and discrepancies from such expectations. Moreover, we derive 40	   behavioral and neural model-based predictions for healthy controls and clinical populations 41	   with impairments of motivation. Second, we illustrate the possible translation to effort-based 42	   behavior of the HER model, an extended version of PRO model based on hierarchical error 43	   prediction, developed to explain MPFC-DLPFC interactions. We derive behavioral predictions 44	   which describe how effort and reward information is coded in PFC, and how changing the 45	   configuration of such environmental information might affect decision-making and task46	   performance involving motivation. 47

48	   Introduction
49	   Attaining a goal often requires commitment, implementation of a precise course of actions, and 50	   deployment of sufficient resources to reach successful completion. How humans fulfill this 51	   process is largely investigated in the field of cognitive neuroscience under the term of goal52	   directed behavior. A crucial underlying cognitive mechanism is prediction: the ability to 53	   evaluate the environment, formulate expectations about future events based on previous 54	   experiences, and finally compare such expectations with subsequent outcomes in order to 55	   update one’s knowledge about the current state of the world. Furthermore, adaptive interaction 56	   with the environment entails predicting the impact of one’s action and evaluating outcomes. 57	   The human Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is the neural machinery that supports crucial mechanisms 58	   involved in goal-directed behavior (Miller & Cohen, 2001). In particular, the medial portion of 59	   PFC (MPFC, including dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex, dACC) is implicated in prediction 60	   and outcome evaluation (Alexander & Brown, 2011; Jahn, Nee, Alexander, & Brown, 2014), 61	   including situations in which the outcome carries value for the agent, such as a reward 62	   (Rushworth, Walton, Kennerley, & Bannerman, 2004; Silvetti, Seurinck, & Verguts, 2011, 63	   2013; Vassena, Krebs, Silvetti, Fias, & Verguts, 2014). Notably, a variety of other functions 64	   have been attributed to MPFC (Vassena, Holroyd, & Alexander, 2017), including error 65	   monitoring, (Holroyd, Nieuwenhuis, Mars, & Coles, 2004; van Veen, Holroyd, Cohen, Stenger, 66	   & Carter, 2004), conflict detection (Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001), pain and 67	   affect processing (Bush, Luu, & Posner, 2000; Nee, Kastner, & Brown, 2011), and value-based 68	   decision-making (Rangel & Hare, 2010; Rushworth, Kolling, Sallet, & Mars, 2012; Rushworth 69	   & Behrens, 2008). Recent computational work has explained this array of empirical findings 70	   under the unifying principle of prediction and prediction error. In this framework, MPFC 71	   formulates predictions tracking stimuli, actions and outcomes, and computes a signal termed 72	   prediction error, which scales with the discrepancy between predicted and actual outcomes

73	   (Predicted Response Outcome model, PRO model, Alexander & Brown, 2011). This 74	   mechanism allows rapid prediction updating according to environmental feedback, be it an 75	   error, a painful stimulus, or a reward. An extended version of the same model, the Hierarchical 76	   Error Representation model (HER, Alexander & Brown 2015), expands the same 77	   computational principle in a hierarchical architecture, capturing more complex high-level 78	   cognitive processes involving the interaction of MPFC and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), 79	   typically associated with higher-level cognitive functions such as working memory and goal80	   maintenance (Miller & Cohen, 2001).
81	   The goal of this manuscript is to explore the power of these computational accounts, in terms of 82	   generating novel neural and behavioral predictions for untested contexts and populations. These 83	   frameworks have proven useful across several fields of cognition, yet they have not been put to 84	   test in the field of effortful behavior and motivation. Goal-directed behavior generally involves 85	   competing factors, including the value of the prospective goals, how much effort one is willing 86	   to exert to attain the desired goal, and preparation for the necessary effortful performance 87	   (Botvinick & Braver, 2015; Westbrook & Braver, 2013, 2015). First, we will describe MPFC 88	   involvement in effort-based behavior. Then, we illustrate how the PRO model can be 89	   generalized to the domain of motivation. We propose that MPFC activity reflects monitoring of 90	   motivationally relevant variables such as reward and required effort, instead of coding an 91	   explicit cost-benefit or choice signal per se. We illustrate novel model-based simulations, as 92	   well as theoretical predictions, which can be used to guide further empirical enquiry. We 93	   discuss how the PRO framework makes neural and behavioral predictions for clinical 94	   conditions in which motivation is impaired, such as depression and other psychiatric disorders 95	   (Treadway, Bossaller, Shelton, & Zald, 2012). Subsequently, we discuss the future directions in 96	   translating the HER model to the domain of motivation, extrapolating behavioral predictions.

97	   From such predictions, we derive implications for measuring and potentially training 98	   motivation-related cognitive mechanisms in clinical populations.
99	   Effort-based decision-making and performance in MPFC
100	   Experimental manipulation of effort in behavioral and neuroimaging experiments has yielded a 101	   wealth of findings in the past decade. Typically, effort is perceived as aversive (Kool, 102	   McGuire, Rosen, & Botvinick, 2010), yet humans decide to engage in it when doing so leads to 103	   a benefit, such as a reward. In the framework of decision-making and neuroeconomics, the net 104	   value of a potential reward is discounted (i.e. decreased) by the amount of effort required to 105	   obtain the reward (Apps, Grima, Manohar, & Husain, 2015; Hartmann, Hager, Tobler, & 106	   Kaiser, 2013; Nishiyama, 2014). This seems to hold across different types of effort (Nishiyama, 107	   2016), and guides decisions to engage one’s resources in the task at hand (Kurzban, 108	   Duckworth, Kable, & Myers, 2013). Several studies in animals described the neural 109	   mechanisms underlying this cost-benefit evaluation, showing a pivotal role of MPFC in 110	   interaction with striatal and sub-cortical nuclei (Hosokawa, Kennerley, Sloan, & Wallis, 2013; 111	   Kennerley, Dahmubed, Lara, & Wallis, 2009; Rushworth & Behrens, 2008; Walton, Kennerley, 112	   Bannerman, Phillips, & Rushworth, 2006; Walton et al., 2009; Walton, Bannerman, Alterescu, 113	   & Rushworth, 2003;. Walton, Bannerman, & Rushworth, 2002; Walton, Rudebeck, 114	   Bannerman, & Rushworth, 2007). In the last few years a similar network has been 115	   characterized in humans. Lesions of MPFC may result in a condition known as akinetic mutism 116	   (Devinsky, Morrell, & Vogt, 1995), whereby patients show difficulties in initiating speech and 117	   movement, not due to an impairment of related systems, but rather to the inability or “lack of 118	   will” to start it. Electrical stimulation of the same region seems to induce a general feeling of 119	   being more motivated and more willing to persevere in effortful endeavors (Parvizi, 120	   Rangarajan, Shirer, Desai, & Greicius, 2013, although this single-case study presents some 121	   methodological caveats). More recently, neuroimaging studies have shown involvement of the

122	   striatum and MPFC in effort-reward trade-off computations (Botvinick, Huffstetler, & 123	   McGuire, 2009; Croxson, Walton, O’Reilly, Behrens, & Rushworth, 2009; Engstrom, 124	   Landtblom, & Karlsson, 2013; Massar, Libedinsky, Weiyan, Huettel, & Chee, 2015; Mulert et 125	   al., 2008). Furthermore, expecting to perform a more cognitively challenging task is associated 126	   with increased activity in striatum and MPFC, overlapping with activity induced by the 127	   prospect of a higher reward (Krebs, Boehler, Roberts, Song, & Woldorff, 2012; Vassena, 128	   Silvetti, et al., 2014).
129	   These results suggest a crucial contribution of MPFC to effort-based behavior, hypothesized to 130	   compute the willingness to engage in the task at hand, given that upon completion a reward will 131	   be received. This principle has been defined in recent theories (Holroyd & Yeung, 2012; 132	   Shenhav, Botvinick, & Cohen, 2013), and formalized in a computational model wherein MPFC 133	   calculates the value of boosting certain actions over others, accordingly guiding behavior in 134	   cognitive and physical tasks (Verguts, Vassena, & Silvetti, 2015). Such computations are 135	   thought to influence decision-making (Treadway, Buckholtz, et al., 2012), resource allocation, 136	   task preparation (Kurniawan, Guitart-Masip, Dayan, & Dolan, 2013; Vassena, Silvetti, et al., 137	   2014), and response vigor (Kurniawan, Guitart-Masip, & Dolan, 2011), even at the lowest 138	   layers of the motor system (Vassena, Cobbaert, Andres, Fias, & Verguts, 2015).
139	   In summary, growing evidence supports a pivotal role of MPFC in effort-based behavior. 140	   However, such empirical effects and theorizing efforts have so far failed to provide a precise 141	   computational characterization able to account for this line of evidence within other existing 142	   computational frameworks of MPFC function.
143	   The Predicted Response Outcome (PRO) Model
144	   According to the PRO model, MPFC implements two core mechanisms: 1) learning to predict 145	   the outcome of responses generated in response to environmental stimuli and 2) signaling

146	   discrepancies between predictions and observations. Using these two primary signals as an 147	   index of MPFC activity, the PRO model has previously been shown to account for a range of 148	   effects observed in MPFC related to cognitive control and decision making, including effects of 149	   error, conflict, and error likelihood. Critically, the PRO model explains these effects without 150	   reference to the underlying affective import: feedback related to behavioral error is equivalent 151	   to feedback indicating correct behavior in the sense that both forms of feedback constitute an 152	   outcome that can be predicted on the basis of task-related stimuli. An open question, therefore, 153	   is how the PRO model might be extended to account for effects in which behavior is influenced 154	   not only by the likelihood of an event occurring, but also by the value of that event.

158	   Translating the PRO model to effort-based motivation

159	   According to the PRO framework, MPFC activity encodes prediction error, resulting in 160	   increased activity for more unexpected (surprising) events. However, several studies 161	   investigating effort-based behavior report increased activity in the same region of MPFC when 162	   more effort needs to be invested (i.e. in presence of a more demanding task, Krebs et al., 2012; 163	   Vassena, Silvetti, et al., 2014). To reconcile this apparent inconsistency, we hypothesize that 164	   MPFC contribution to effort-based decision making parallels its role in cognitive control – 165	   MPFC predicts the amount of effort (as well as reward) associated with certain environmental 166	   cues, and the likelihood of the choice to engage or not in the required behavior. In other words, 167	   we propose that MPFC monitors effort cues and decisions, with the same mechanisms used to 168	   monitor the occurrence of any other stimulus and response outcome.

169	   Decisions regarding whether to engage in an effortful task carry multiple consequences. First, 170	   the choice to perform an effortful task entails exerting actual effort in order to perform the task 171	   (regardless whether the task is performed successfully or not). Additionally, performing a task 172	   carries with it the possibility of success, in which case the subject receives positive feedback, 173	   often in the form of monetary reward. Alternately, the subject may fail to perform the task 174	   successfully, in which case negative feedback is provided indicating failure. In the simulations, 175	   such failure corresponds to not realizing the monetary reward, rather than losing money 176	   (although a loss condition could also be simulated as easily). In the framework of the PRO 177	   model, then, the outcomes predicted during choices regarding whether to engage in an effortful 178	   task are 1) the level of effort to be exerted and 2) the potential expected payoff. Furthermore, 179	   our implementation relies on two assumptions. First, greater effort is considered an aversive 180	   outcome, which generally tends to be avoided if possible (Kool et al., 2010). Second, as in the 181	   original model implementation (Alexander & Brown, 2011), outcomes can be more or less 182	   salient: increasing levels of reward and effort correspond to increasing salience in the model. 183	   This assumption is based on the observation that effort is frequently perceived as aversive, 184	   plausibly generating increased arousal level.
185	   Under these assumptions, we simulated effort-based decision making with the PRO model. The 186	   parameter set used here was the same used in simulations reported in earlier work (Alexander 187	   & Brown, 2011, 2014), with no additions to the architecture of the model, and therefore not 188	   specifically tailored to the current context (the code is available at 189	   https://github.com/modelbrains/PRO_Effort). One should note that in this case the PRO model 190	   is not performing the task itself, but rather monitoring the choice of engaging in more or less 191	   effortful and rewarding trials (i.e. updating its predictions as a function of the experienced 192	   effort and reward, as if the task had been performed), as opposed to accepting a default option 193	   with a low reward value and no effort. In this formulation, MPFC activity reflects a monitoring

194	   signal, tracking the (un)predictability of motivationally relevant variables, instead of explicitly 195	   computing a cost-benefit trade off or driving choice. Related work (cf. Brown & Alexander, 196	   this issue) suggests how signals generated by the PRO model may be deployed elsewhere in the 197	   brain to drive choice behavior. Additionally, the adaptation of the PRO model to the context of 198	   effort-based decision-making suggests that the role of MPFC is primarily in monitoring the 199	   level of prospective reward and effort, and does not necessarily drive decisions to engage in a 200	   proposed task, nor, once engaged, to maintain performance levels sufficient to realize 201	   successful completion of a task. Rather, according with additional applications of the PRO 202	   model in this issue (cfr. Brown & Alexander, this issue), signals generated by MPFC are 203	   incorporated into decision processes occurring beyond cingulate itself. This interpretation of 204	   MPFC function is at odds with other models of MPFC function (Holroyd & Yeung, 2012; 205	   Shenhav et al., 2013), and provides a novel view of the role of MPFC in motivated behavior 206	   that may be the target of future research.

207	   For simulations of the effort-based decision-making task, the model was presented a compound 208	   cue indicating the level of prospective reward (4 levels) and level of prospective effort (4 209	   levels). Each reward level was modeled as a single input unit, as was each effort level, for a 210	   total of 16 unique compound stimuli reflecting combinations of effort and reward information. 211	   Following a decision to perform the task, the model received feedback related to the level of 212	   reward received and the level of effort expended. The strength of the feedback signal for both 213	   effort and reward was set to the level indicated by the corresponding model input (1 through 4) 214	   multiplied by a constant (0.48 for reward, 0.55 for effort). The constant was selected by hand 215	   to reproduce the qualitative pattern of behavioral effects reported in the literature (Klein216	   Flügge, Kennerley, Saraiva, Penny, & Bestmann, 2015). Following a decision not to engage in 217	   the effort task, feedback was set to 1/4 of the lowest reward level.

219	   Figure 2 shows the results of the simulations. The model behavior replicates qualitatively effort 220	   avoidance tendencies of human participants (see Figure 2a): as the required effort (task 221	   difficulty) increases, the probability of engaging in the task decreases (i.e. the prediction that 222	   one will choose to engage). Plausibly, the prospect of a high reward changes this pattern: when 223	   a higher reward is expected, the probability of engaging in more effortful tasks decreases only 224	   slightly relative to low reward conditions. These behavioral predictions are consistent with 225	   empirical findings of previous studies (Apps et al., 2015; Klein-Flügge, Kennerley, Friston, & 226	   Bestmann, 2016). By looking at activity of the prediction units in the PRO model (Figure 2b), 227	   one can extrapolate quantitative predictions about expected activity in MPFC across different 228	   effort and reward conditions. According to the simulation, MPFC activity monotonically and 229	   linearly increases as a function of increased required effort (task difficulty) when reward 230	   prospect is high. However, when reward prospect is low, MPFC activity increases less steeply 231	   and only up to a certain degree of required effort, subsequently decreasing as the probability of 232	   engaging in trials with high-demand for low reward drops. To our knowledge, this neural 233	   prediction is yet to be tested and could be investigated by recording MPFC activity during 234	   effort-based decision-making when difficulty is manipulated parametrically.
235	   Alternative models of effort-based behavior
236	   Other theoretical and computational models have been developed to account for MPFC 237	   contribution to effort-based behavior (Shenhav et al., 2013; Verguts et al., 2015). These models 238	   present one major difference with respect to the PRO framework: they explicitly operationalize 239	   effort as a cost to be computed in MPFC. As a result, while these models work well in 240	   predicting effort-based decisions and task-performance, they do not provide an explicit 241	   computational characterization of how MPFC contributes to other empirical effects.
242	   Verguts and colleagues (2015) assign MPFC a role in calculating the benefit of deploying effort 243	   in addition to signaling potential rewarding outcomes. Their adaptive effort investment model

244	   operationalizes effort explicitly by implementing what the authors call “boosting”. In this 245	   model, units representing MPFC activity compute the value of boosting, namely exerting the 246	   effort needed to energize a more difficult action (be it a physical action or a cognitive task). 247	   Boosting, as in exerting effort, entails a cost. If the value of boosting outweighs the cost, the 248	   more effortful action will be selected. This results in the following predicted pattern of activity: 249	   overall activity in MPFC should be higher for larger rewards, increase with increasing task250	   difficulty as long as the reward is worth the effort, and drop for tasks too difficult to be solved. 251	   To our knowledge, this prediction still requires empirical testing. In line with this model, 252	   Shenhav and colleagues proposed the “expected value of control theory” (EVC, Shenhav et al. 253	   2013).This theoretical framework assigns MPFC the role of computing the value of exerting 254	   control, by combining “component computations” estimating costs, benefits, and consequences 255	   associated with control signals (Shenhav, Cohen, & Botvinick, 2016). Input signals to such 256	   computations may include error, conflict, difficulty and prediction errors signals, which may 257	   originate outside MPFC.
258	   From the implementation point of view one should consider that the adaptive effort allocation 259	   and EVC frameworks rely on very different assumptions as compared to the PRO model. The 260	   first two place computation of the value of boosting (for cognitive or physical action in Verguts 261	   et al.) or exerting control (cognitive tasks in Shenhav et al.) in MPFC, while the PRO model 262	   places prediction and prediction error computations in MPFC. Moreover, whereas the PRO 263	   model postulates a shared underlying computational principle, adaptive effort allocation and 264	   EVC imply the coexistence of different computations (cost and value of boosting, and 265	   prediction error for the first, separate cost, benefit and consequences estimation for the second). 266	   However, further modeling work is required to extrapolate predictions, which may disentangle 267	   the models based on available empirical evidence.

268	   The main advantage of the PRO model is parsimony: the same architecture explains effort269	   related effects as well as a wide variety of empirical effects previously measured in MPFC 270	   (ranging from prediction error, cognitive control, conflict and so forth, Alexander & Brown, 271	   2011). This is not the case for the adaptive effort investment model, which is specifically 272	   tailored for effort-based behavior and is therefore not applicable in other contexts, at least in its 273	   current implementation.
274	   One limitation of the PRO model is that it does not perform the task and is not responsible for 275	   action selection: MPFC units compute predictions and compare them with outcomes. This 276	   assumes that the reward and cost trade-off computations, and the choice to engage or not in the 277	   task at hand are implemented elsewhere. Candidate areas could potentially be other sub-regions 278	   of PFC, or possibly the basal ganglia and especially the striatum, shown in several studies in 279	   both humans and animals to contribute to effort-based decisions and task-preparation (Bailey, 280	   Simpson, & Balsam, 2016; Botvinick et al., 2009; Prévost, Pessiglione, Météreau, Cléry-Melin, 281	   & Dreher, 2010; Salamone, Correa, Farrar, & Mingote, 2007; Vassena et al., 2014). One 282	   shortcoming common to both PRO and EVC/adaptive effort allocation frameworks is that they 283	   are agnostic about cost computation. Effort is plausibly defined as a function of task-difficulty 284	   and higher effort equals higher cost. However the nature and source of such cost signal, is a 285	   topic of ongoing empirical and theoretical work (Holroyd, 2016; Kurzban et al., 2013).
286	   Predictions and implications for clinical populations
287	   Adaptive decision-making and energization of behavior poses a challenge in several daily life 288	   situations. In a number of psychiatric conditions, these mechanisms are impaired. Recent 289	   studies showed that decision-making regarding whether to undertake an effortful task is altered 290	   in depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Barch, Treadway, & Schoen, 2014; Culbreth, 291	   Westbrook, & Barch, 2016; Hershenberg et al., 2016; McCarthy, Treadway, Bennett, & 292	   Blanchard, 2016; Silvia et al., 2016; Silvia, Nusbaum, Eddington, Beaty, & Kwapil, 2014;

293	   Treadway, 2016; Treadway, Bossaller, et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014). Symptoms often include 294	   reduced willingness to exert effort, although data across different pathologies or effort types do 295	   not always align. For example, both schizophrenia and depressed patients show reduced 296	   allocation of physical effort for higher rewards as compared to controls, while evidence 297	   concerning cognitive effort is mixed (Barch, Pagliaccio, & Luking, 2016). The same authors 298	   suggest a different underlying deficit for the two conditions: depressed patients seem to show 299	   impaired hedonic processing, while schizophrenia patients tend to show impaired 300	   reinforcement learning and action selection. Moreover, effort-related deficits in schizophrenia 301	   point to an effort allocation deficit, rather than reduced effort expenditure per se (McCarthy et 302	   al., 2016; Treadway, Peterman, Zald, & Park, 2015), with patients performing less optimal 303	   decisions. Such a complex picture confirms alteration of effort-based decision-making in such 304	   clinical populations, and calls for more precise quantitative frameworks, able to identify the 305	   mechanisms underlying different impairments.

306	   Here, we use the PRO model, adapted as described above for modeling effort-related dynamics 307	   in healthy subjects, to simulate the possible neuroetiology underlying clinical disorders, which 308	   could explain the behavioral symptoms measured in clinical samples. In the PRO model, 309	   outcome representation units may be modulated by salience (Alexander & Brown, 2011) 310	   suggesting that compromised function in clinical populations may be a result of altered 311	   perception of salient events (Alexander, Fukunaga, Finn, & Brown, 2015). Model simulations 312	   and theoretical predictions are described in Figure 3.

314	   These simulations use the basic architecture of the PRO model without modification as in 315	   simulation 1. In order to simulate altered function during effort-based decision-making, we 316	   assume that clinical disorders entail alterations in the processing of information related either to 317	   reward or effort information. One possible alteration driving impairment in decision-making

318	   could be attributed to a global salience change: in some populations, the global salience of 319	   decision variables might be affected. Patients may be overly sensitive to the costs of engaging 320	   in a task (such as required effort, simulation 2, Figure 3b), or have reduced sensitivity to 321	   potential reward (simulation 3, Figure 3c). To simulate these hypotheses, we multiply the effort 322	   level from simulation by a factor of 2 (simulation 2), or the reward information by a factor of 323	   0.5 (simulation 3) to reflect increased effort salience or decreased reward salience. The results 324	   of these simulations show that increasing the salience of effort and reducing the salience of 325	   reward have similar effects in the model: the probability of engaging in a task is decreased over 326	   all levels of reward and effort. The pattern of MPFC activity predicted by the model is also 327	   severely attenuated relative to control simulation: activity is slightly higher in the high reward 328	   as compared to low reward condition, but does not seem to track effort as it did in the control 329	   simulation.
330	   Another possible alteration underlying the impairment in clinical populations might be a 331	   mismatch: predictions made by the model regarding effort and reward levels might not 332	   correspond to veridical experience. The model may overestimate the level of effort required 333	   (simulation 4) or underestimate the value of the reward on offer (simulation 5). The inability to 334	   accurately estimate required effort and potential reward, would generate a mismatch between 335	   prediction and outcome: predicted effort could be overestimated, leading to abnormal effort 336	   avoidance, while mismatches between predicted and experienced reward could lead to 337	   decreased motivation in performing the task. To simulate these hypotheses, effort-related 338	   feedback to the model was multiplied by a factor of 2 (simulation 4), while the valence 339	   information used for updating top-down control weights (Alexander & Brown, 2011, 340	   supplementary Figure 1) remained unchanged. The net effect is that the model's prediction of 341	   effort level exceeds the effort experienced by the model following choices to engage in an 342	   effortful task. In simulation 5, reward-related feedback to the model was multiplied by 0.5

343	   (while valence information was unchanged), with the interpretation that the level of predicted 344	   reward did not match the experienced level. Simulation results for effort mismatch (Fig. 3d) 345	   and reward mismatch (Fig. 3e) show that such mismatches in effort and reward prediction yield 346	   qualitatively different predictions regarding behavior: overestimation of effort level leads to 347	   increased discounting of low reward offers, while behavior in high-reward conditions is 348	   relatively unaffected compared to control simulations. Conversely, underestimation of reward 349	   produces a general increase in discounting - both high and low reward conditions are 350	   discounted more heavily compared to control simulations.
351	   To our knowledge, the hypothesized mechanisms (global salience impairment vs. 352	   predicted/actual mismatch) cannot be disentangled on the basis of existing data. Future 353	   experimental work to test this may incorporate a model-based fMRI experiment with patients 354	   performing an effort-based decision-making task. One could simulate model-based predictors 355	   of MPFC activity for each hypothesized mechanism on the basis of subjects’ actual 356	   performance. This would show which mechanisms better explain brain activity measured in 357	   MPFC (i.e. the one giving better fit between model activity and neural data). Empirical 358	   verification in clinical populations showing impairments of effort-based behavior would shed 359	   light on potential mechanisms underlying symptoms origin and provide (in)validation for the 360	   PRO as plausible neurofunctional account of MPFC contribution to motivated behavior. 361	   Limitations and critical aspects
362	   Translating the PRO framework to a motivational context allows explaining effort-based 363	   behavior under a working computational model of MPFC functioning without postulating a 364	   MPFC function dedicated to explicit cost computations. However, this translation leaves some 365	   critical aspects unanswered, open for future research. First, in our conceptualization we do not 366	   distinguish between different types of effort costs, such as physical vs. cognitive effort. Here 367	   we only assume higher effort to be more salient and aversive, irrespective of its specific nature.

368	   Previous research comparing neural circuits involved in different effortful tasks (Schmidt, 369	   Lebreton, Cléry-Melin, Daunizeau, & Pessiglione, 2012) suggests that the type of effort 370	   determined the network involved in task execution, with motor regions implicated in a physical 371	   task as opposed to parietal regions implicated in a cognitive task. In both cases, the relevant 372	   network was more active in the high effort condition. Moreover, a shared motivational hub was 373	   identified in the striatum, showing increased activity irrespective of effort type. In both animal 374	   and human research the striatum has been implicated in cost-benefit trade-offs (Botvinick et al., 375	   2009; Salamone et al., 2016; Vassena, Silvetti, et al., 2014; Westbrook, A. & Braver, 2016), 376	   and is often co-active with MPFC. An intriguing possibility is that striatal dopamine-driven 377	   trade-off computations provide MPFC with the necessary cost signal regulating subsequent 378	   behavior, irrespective of effort type. These speculations should be investigated in further 379	   research.
380	   Second, we do not include a mechanistic explanation of the aversive nature of effort. The 381	   neural origin of this computation is still debated in the literature. It has been proposed that 382	   perception of effort cost derives from its opportunity cost (i.e. engaging resources which could 383	   be utilized differently, Kurzban et al., 2013). A recent account hypothesizes effort cost to 384	   derive from accumulation of waste product at the neural level, resulting from using up neural 385	   resources (Holroyd, 2016). The model is currently agnostic to the origin of this signal, which 386	   we consider an avenue for future modeling and experimental work.
387	   Third, we formulated effort-based behavior as a decision-making problem, where effort and 388	   reward are considered outcomes of the decision to engage in the task at hand. However, this 389	   does not account for monitoring ongoing effort exertion. Maintaining a certain level of vigor 390	   throughout a period (e.g. holding a grip) could be seen as the result of a series of decisions to 391	   keep engaging throughout the entire period, depending on (presumably striatal) cost and reward

392	   signals fed into MPFC. This intriguing idea should be addressed in future modeling and 393	   experimental work.
394	   Fourth, we do not simulate MPFC activity variations within a trial. Theoretically, the PRO 395	   model states that MPFC continuously predicts stimulus-outcome associations (Alexander & 396	   Brown, 2014). This means that at the beginning of a trial, prior to effort or reward related 397	   information being presented, the model would predict average outcomes (in the context of 398	   effort-based decision-making, these predictions would converge on the mean reward and effort 399	   for the overall task). Following cue presentation, this prediction would be updated when 400	   experiencing the actual effort, suggesting that MPFC activity should reflect the degree by 401	   which task-related cues on a specific trial diverge from the average experimental value. 402	   Preliminary evidence for such a computation is reported in a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation 403	   study measuring motor-evoked potentials (Vassena et al., 2015), which showed that motor 404	   cortex excitability during cue presentation was related to prediction error in expected value 405	   (discrepancy between average expected value and value of the actual cue on the current trial, 406	   integrating a certain degree of required effort and potential reward). However, how this result 407	   speaks to MPFC contribution in the process remains to be investigated. Conversely, activity 408	   following the choice regarding whether to engage with an effortful task should vary inversely 409	   with the tendency of the subject to engage: subjects with a lower overall tendency to engage in 410	   effortful tasks should show increased MPFC activity following choices to engage, while 411	   subjects with a strong tendency for engaging should show increased MPFC activity following 412	   choices not to engage. These theoretical predictions require empirical testing, and possibly 413	   additional modeling work to specify them quantitatively. From the methodological point view, 414	   one would need to collect fMRI data at a time scale with sufficient resolution to contrast MPFC 415	   activity at both cue and outcome, or to use EEG-fMRI simultaneous recordings to localize 416	   MPFC electrophysiological signature.

417	   Effort-based decision-making and performance in DLPFC

418	   In the existing literature, the link between DLPFC and effort-based behavior is more implicit, 419	   although it clearly emerges from the number of high-level functions implicating this region. 420	   Traditionally, DLPFC is assigned a pivotal role in supporting working memory updating and 421	   maintenance (Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003; Miller & Cohen, 2001). In recent years, evidence has 422	   accumulated showing a crucial contribution of this region to executive functions, including 423	   goal-maintenance and task-set representation (Ridderinkhof, van den Wildenberg, Segalowitz, 424	   & Carter, 2004). Activity in DLPFC is associated with maintaining stimulus representations 425	   and strategies for optimal task performance. Although several frameworks have been proposed 426	   to explain DLPFC function (Badre, 2008; Koechlin, 2014), a mechanistic account of how such 427	   representations and strategies are formed and manipulated to guide goal-directed behavior is 428	   still lacking. How DLPFC interacts with MPFC prediction signals remains unclear. Several 429	   studies investigating motivation and task-preparation report co-activation of DLPFC and MPFC 430	   (Botvinick & Braver, 2015; Chong et al., 2017; Engström, Karlsson, Landtblom, & Craig, 431	   2014; Engstrom et al., 2013; Krebs et al., 2012; Rypma, Berger, & D’Esposito, 2002; Vassena, 432	   Silvetti, et al., 2014). Across these studies, DLPFC activity increases as a function of expected 433	   effort, task-load and working memory demands. Recently, starting from the principles outlined 434	   in the PRO model, it has been proposed that the underlying computational mechanism of 435	   DLPFC might also rely on the prediction and prediction error (Alexander & Brown, 2015). 436	   These authors proposed an updated version of the PRO model, extended in a hierarchical 437	   architecture: the Hierarchical Error Representation model (HER).

438	  

------------------ Insert Figure 4 here -----------------

439	   The HER model is composed of 2 or more hierarchical layers, and each layer replicates the 440	   functional form of the PRO model. The lowest layer receives input and feedback from the 441	   environment, updating predictions via prediction error, computed as the discrepancy between

442	   predicted and actual outcome. Additionally, the error signal also provides input to the layer 443	   above, where it is treated as a feedback signal; in other words, this higher layer learns 444	   predictions of the expected error of the lower layer, compares such prediction with the actual 445	   error signal, and updates the error prediction accordingly. This simple architecture provides a 446	   mechanistic account of how MPFC and DLPFC might interact, congruent with available 447	   empirical evidence (Alexander & Brown, 2015, 2016). The prediction error signal generated in 448	   MPFC not only results in an updated error prediction at the highest layer: this prediction is also 449	   linked to the environmental stimulus (or context), which was associated with the error. This 450	   results in a representation linking the error signal to the stimulus (or context) that preceded the 451	   error. In agreement with a substantial body of evidence, this model accounts for the primary 452	   role of MPFC in performance monitoring and error detection, and for the role of DLPFC in 453	   maintaining task-set representations providing context for MPFC function.
454	   Future directions: translating the HER model to effort-based behavior
455	   Despite its wide explanatory power, the HER framework has to date not been translated to the 456	   domain of motivation to accommodate for the aforementioned effort and task-load effects 457	   observed in DLPFC. In the previous sections we showed the potential of the PRO model to 458	   explain effort-related effects. Fundamentally, the HER model is an extension of the PRO 459	   model, which suggests it might be well suited for a comparable translation to the effort domain.
460	   The aim of the current section is twofold. First we propose a theoretical explanation of how 461	   DLPFC-MPFC interaction in the context of the HER model could account for motivational 462	   effects observed in both regions. Second, we derive informal behavioral predictions from the 463	   HER model in its current formulation which can be tested in both healthy and clinical 464	   populations to further challenge the validity of the model. One should note that such 465	   interpretations and prediction are highly speculative at this stage. The purpose of this section is 466	   to provide a series of directions and predictions to drive empirical investigation of DLPFC-

467	   MPFC contribution to effort-based behavior.
468	   The HER model is built on the principle that error signals in MPFC are equivalent to other 469	   environmental feedback signals, and are therefore subject to the same prediction and error 470	   processes. When an error signal is unexpected, the error prediction is updated. This error 471	   history is stored in DLPFC as error representations linked to stimuli or environmental contexts. 472	   This implies that when the same stimulus or environmental context reoccurs, the corresponding 473	   DLPFC error representation is also reactivated. We hypothesize that this representation will in 474	   turn up-regulate MPFC activity, reinstating the signal experienced at the time of error, but this 475	   time with the purpose of exerting control to prevent the error from happening again (thus 476	   leading to a better prediction, or a successful behavioral outcome). In this formulation, the 477	   translation to a motivational context becomes evident: a performance error, for example due to 478	   task difficulty, would be signaled by increased MPFC activity, tagging that particular 479	   behavioral instance as requiring extra effort. Next time the same instance reoccurs, the 480	   reactivated error representation can provide information necessary to inform top-down control 481	   and resource allocation to result in successful task performance. Noteworthy, this speculative 482	   explanation does not require an explicit operationalization of effort or other motivational 483	   factors: thus, the HER model in its current architecture could be able to account for both 484	   prediction-related as well as effort-related signals in MPFC and DLPFC. The empirical validity 485	   of this explanatory framework is to be tested in future research, which should provide 486	   neurobiological evidence for the type of MPFC-DLPFC dynamics described above.
487	   Besides the theoretical implications for understanding PFC circuitry, the model relies on 488	   assumptions that require empirical testing. The hierarchical structure of the HER model is 489	   consistent with other accounts of PFC function, postulating the existence of a cortical rostro490	   caudal hierarchical gradient (Badre, 2008; Koechlin, 2016). According to these theories, caudal 491	   regions of PFC encode more concrete representations (action-related, or more recent in time),

492	   while more rostral regions encode more abstract representations (task-sets, rules, context or 493	   information further in the past to be maintained). This is implemented in the HER model, 494	   wherein a typical simulation of a working memory task, different items to be stored in working 495	   memory are encoded at different levels of the hierarchy (depending on order of processing, see 496	   for example the 12AX task simulations in Alexander and Brown, 2015). An underlying 497	   assumption is serial processing, not only for series of stimuli, but also for complex stimuli 498	   composed by different stimulus features. When placed in the context of motivation and 499	   decision-making literature, this assumption is quite relevant: most of the experiments 500	   referenced above combine motivationally salient information of different types, such as 501	   required effort and available rewards, presenting it simultaneously. The empirical question 502	   remains open as to whether such simultaneous presentation results in simultaneous or serial 503	   processing of the presented information sources, and to date this question has not been 504	   addressed. The HER framework hypothesizes that such features would be processed serially in 505	   a specific and preferred order. Simulations showed that altering this order, by imposing a non506	   preferred order, can impact performance (Alexander & Brown, 2015).
507	   Presenting motivationally salient information prior to task performance typically influences 508	   accuracy, reaction time and task preparation in several tasks requiring cognitive control (Aarts 509	   & Roelofs, 2010; Boehler, Schevernels, Hopf, Stoppel, & Krebs, 2014; Janssens, De Loof, 510	   Pourtois, & Verguts, 2016; van den Berg, Krebs, Lorist, & Woldorff, 2014; Vassena, Silvetti, et 511	   al., 2014). When applied to the domain of effort-based behavior, the order hypothesis predicts 512	   that altering order of processing of reward and effort information might result in a shift in 513	   perceived subjective value, and consequently affect (improve or deteriorate) performance.
514	   Predictions and implications for clinical populations
515	   These theoretical predictions naturally stem from the HER model, and empirical testing of their 516	   validity carries relevant implications. First, testing these predictions will (dis-)prove the

517	   validity of the assumptions underlying the model. Second, if altering order of processing can 518	   alter decision-making, one could test the potential of such manipulation to improve 519	   dysfunctional decision making, for example concerning health-related behavior such as 520	   physical exercise and eating habits. Third, if altering order of processing can alter performance, 521	   one could devise optimal ways to reconfigure available motivational information to improve 522	   cognitive performance, for example in educational and school settings. Lastly, all of the above 523	   have important implications for translational research and potential applications in clinical 524	   populations affected by disorders of motivation.
525	   To date, the predictions listed above have not been empirically tested. It is however useful to 526	   speculate on the mechanisms, which could underlie such effects. One plausible explanation 527	   involves salience. If effort and reward information is processed serially, the order of processing 528	   when presentation is simultaneous may be influenced by the respective salience of informative 529	   cues. Patients with depression typically show reduced willingness to exert effort to obtain a 530	   reward: in other words they are more effort-avoidant as compared to controls (Treadway, 531	   Buckholtz, Schwartzman, Lambert, & Zald, 2009; Yang et al., 2014). One possible reason 532	   could be the overestimation of the amount of the required effort, which would result in an 533	   unfavorable overall value, leading to the decision of not engaging in the task. Similarly, reward 534	   information could be underestimated, thus reducing the worth of the final value. Note that these 535	   hypotheses are in line with what was formulated and simulated with the PRO model in the 536	   previous section of this manuscript, where we hypothesized impairment in perceived salience 537	   of effort and reward. What is particularly relevant with respect to the order effects, is the 538	   possibility of intervention: motivational impairment could derive from altered perception of 539	   saliency; manipulating order of presentation may enforce a specific order of processing, 540	   artificially increasing or decreasing saliency of effort and/or reward information; by tuning this 541	   manipulation, one might be able to determine the optimal configuration restoring normal

542	   perception of salience. Ideally, this process would result in increasing the willingness to exert 543	   effort in exchange for reward, thus counteracting the typical behavioral pattern of anhedonia, a 544	   core symptom in depression (Silvia et al., 2014; Treadway, Bossaller, et al., 2012). Critically, 545	   alterations in effort- and reward-based decision making have also been reported in other 546	   psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Barch et al., 2014; Fervaha 547	   et al., 2013; Gold, Waltz, & Frank, 2015; Hershenberg et al., 2016) and pre-clinical traits of 548	   apathy (Bonnelle et al., 2015), although showing different patterns of impairment. Testing the 549	   predictions derived from the HER model across different clinical samples could provide 550	   insights on shared and dissociable underlying etiopathogenetic mechanisms; moreover, such 551	   deeper theoretical understanding could foster development of behavioral treatments aimed at 552	   improving decision-making and behavioral outcomes for these patients in daily life.
553	   General discussion
554	   This manuscript reviews the theoretical frameworks provided by the PRO and HER models, 555	   modeling the neurofunctional architecture of MPFC and DLPFC. Such models have originally 556	   been developed based on the core principles of prediction and prediction error to explain 557	   empirical effects found in these regions. Here we discussed how these models may generalize 558	   to the domain of motivation, focusing on effort-based behavior. We show that effort effects in 559	   MPFC can be successfully accounted for by the PRO model, which provides further predictions 560	   regarding behavior and neural activity in both healthy and clinical populations. Furthermore, 561	   we discuss the potential translation of the HER model to the domain of effort-based behavior, 562	   which accounts for empirical effects measured in DLPFC, and provides interesting empirical 563	   predictions regarding the effect of order of processing on decision-making and task564	   performance: if these predictions are borne out, such effects could lead to the development of 565	   useful interventions to influence altered perception of salience of effort and reward information 566	   in clinical population, potentially improving abnormal behavior.

567	   One primary goal of this manuscript is to emphasize the importance of exploiting precise 568	   theoretical frameworks to derive predictions to test experimentally. The first advantage of such 569	   mathematically precise frameworks resides in the ability to explain several behavioral and 570	   neural effects observed in a brain region under the same computational principle. The second 571	   advantage is the possibility to generate new predictions based on the same model, which can 572	   translate to contexts to date untested or different populations. This feature is particularly useful 573	   to guide further theory-driven empirical inquiry. In a scientific age where empirical tools 574	   proliferate, basing experimental research on strong a priori hypotheses has become a necessary 575	   condition to allow drawing statistically meaningful and generalizable conclusions. Finally, such 576	   theoretical rigor and quantitative predictive precision provide a great tool to test potential 577	   translational applications, with broad explanatory power for understanding the neurobiology of 578	   disease.
