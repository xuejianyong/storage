Preface by Series Editor
Mathematics education is now established worldwide as a major area of
study, with numerous dedicated journals and conferences serving national and international communities of scholars. Research in mathematics education is also becoming more theoretically orientated. Vigorous new perspectives are pervading it from disciplines and fields as diverse as psychology, philosophy, logic, sociology, anthropology, history, feminism, cognitive science, semiotics, hermeneutics, post-structuralism and post-modernism. The series Studies in Mathematics Education consists of research contributions to the field based on disciplined perspectives that link theory with practice. It is founded on the philosophy that theory is the practitioner's most powerful tool in understanding anu changing practice. Whether the practice is mathematics teaching, teacher education, or educational research, the series will offer new perspectives to assist in clarifying and posing problems and to stimulate debate. The series Studies in Mathematics Education will encourage the development and dissemination of theoretical perspectives in mathematics education as well as their critical scrutiny. It aims to have a major impact on the development of mathematics education as a field of study into the twenty-first century.
In the past decade or two, the most important theoretical perspective to emerge in mathematics education has been that of constructivism. This burst onto the international scene at the exciting and controversial Eleventh International Conference on the Psychology of Mathematics Education in Montreal, in the Summer of 1983. No one who was there will forget Ernst von Glasersfeld's c21m and authoritative plenary panel presentation on radical constructivism, his replies to critics. That controversy confirmed his earlier observation that To introduce epistemological considerations into a discussion of education has always been dynamite' (Glasersfeld, 1983, p.41). Ironically, the attacks on radical constructivism at that conference, which were perhaps intended to fatally expose its weaknesses, served as a platform from which it was launched to widespread international acceptance and approbation.
In this volume Ernst von Glasersfeld offers what I believe to be the
definitive theoretical account of radical constructivism. It is an elegantly written and thoroughly argued account of this epistemological position, providing a profound analysis of its central concepts. Although he indicates his debt to Jean Piaget (and indeed to collaborators such as Leslie P. Steffe), Glasersfeld

Preface by Series Editor
shows that the roots of radical constructivism are much older. A great strength of the boo'', consists in the two genealogies of kr owledge which are offered as an orientating basis. These veritable genetic epistemologies trace the development of the central ideas of radical constructivism along two tracks. The first is the history of philosophy from the pre-Socratic masters of Ancient Greece to the present. The second is his own intellectual biography. In it Glasersfeld illustrates how a number of lines of thought from cybernetics, linguistics, developmental psychology, cognitive science and philosophy be-
came synthesized into radical constructivism. Given these diverse roots, I
expect this first full articulation of the theory to have an influence that extends beyond mathematics education.
Radical constructivism is a progressive research programme with many strengths. To mention but two, it is first of all a sceptical position in epistemology, which incorporates a fallibilist view of mathematics. This is consistent with much of the latest work in the philosophy of mathematics, as earlier volumes in the series show. Secondly, radical constructivism continues to grow and develop. The definitive account that this book provides will in no way inhibit its continued growth and development, and its practical applications. I predict that the book will be very influential in both grounding and stimulating farther work in this orientation, and will be much cited by researchers investigating understanding and the learning of mathematics. I can think of no better volume to exemplify the series philosophy than the present
one.

Preface
Twenty years ago, when Charles Smock and I put together our research report on epistemology and education, we chose as subtitle: The implications of radical constructivism for knowledge acquisition' (1974). It was the first time that the word 'radical' was associated with Piaget's genetic epistemology. Charles, who had worked with Piaget at Geneva, sent a copy of the report to the master. who had introduced the constructivist approach to cognition in the 1930s. A few weeks later, Charles received a most encouraging acknowledgment: 'I always appreciate what you write,' Piaget said, 'you are one of the few Americans who have understood me' (April, 1975).
Since then I have learned that Piaget was a most reluctant reader of other people's writings. In the case of our report, I obviously prefer to think that he looked at it.
About that time I began to work with Les Steffe on the constructivist approach to the learning and teaching of arithmetic. Without him, radical constructivism would have remained a private enterprise. His flair for producing plausible operational analyses of what elementary-school children seem to be doing when they try to handle numbers, led to practical applications in school rooms. Wherever the experiment was continued for at least two years, the results far exceeded our expectations. More than anything else, this encouraged me to continue with the elaboration of the constructivist theory of knowing.
What we did not expect at all, was that 'radical constructivism' would become a catch word with all the advantages and disadvantages popularization brings. Reactions have varied a great deal, and on both the positive and the negative side, they have at times been somewhat passionate. The purpose of this book, therefore, is to lay out the main constructivist ideas as I see them.
It will surprise some readers that I occasionally pit my ideas against behaviourism. They may feel that I am flogging a dead horse. I would agree that behaviourisni is passé as a movement. but some of its central notions are still very much alive, both in psychology and education. Those who cling to them are likely to get a distorted view of constructivism.
Most of this text is new, but the ideas it expounds have been central to my work for many years. Some are expanded here, others compressed. Wherever there are actual overlaps with earlier papers, I have indicated them.

Preface
In the first chapter I recount how I personally came to adopt a constructivist way of thinking. The second is a biased run through the history of western philosophy. It is intended to show that there is nothing very new about the ideas that form the core of my orientation. I limited the survey to philosophers and did not mention writers, such as Pirandello, Musil, and Fowles, who developed their own constructivism. Even so, I am aware of holes, and have no doubt that there are omissions of which I am not aware.
I suspect it happens to everyone who is trying to formulate the results of lengthy reflections. You sit with pen in hand, or at your keyboard, and look at the sentence you have just written. There seems to be nothing you want to change. But suddenly you feel uncertain: where did this come from? Have I read it somewhere? You search your mind and ask yourself, who might have said such a thing?
I have a for of books, and on some occasions I spend half a day or more looking in likely places, usually without success. It is not easy to spot a sentence in hundreds of pages, especially when the search must be in different languages. And if one has done some reading in libraries that are now far away, it is impossible to retrieve forgotten sources. By now, I have given up. I realized that whatever I write will have been said by someone somewhere. Ideas, I tell myself, should never be personal property. What matters is how one uses them. Thus I have tried to give credit wherever I can, and hope not to have made improper use of what I may have unknowingly appropriated.
Chapters 3, 4, and 5, explain my reading of Piaget and how some of the ideas I had used in my earlier work on conceptual analysis could be merged with his. Chapters 6, 7, and 8, present models that to me seem crucial elements in the constructivist edifice: the concept of self and others, the function of language, and the view of information and control that was developed in the field of cybernetics.
Chapter 9 describes a hypothetical model for the generation of units, pluralities, and numbers. It is the model that Steffe and I have been using in our work on the development of arithmetical concepts in children. Although these concepts are very specific, I feel that the method of analysis could be useful to teachers, educators, and, more generally, anyone who is interested in developing or modifying the conceptual structures that others seem to have in their heads.
Chapter 10 was the most difficult to write, because in the field of education I feel more of a foreigner than in the other disciplines I have invaded. It is, again, in the personal genre of Chapter 1, and reflects my view of education. Most of the suggestions I make, are not my invention but stem from the ongoing work of others. I am painfully aware of having left out references to many who have successfully applied constructivist ideas in their research and teaching. I can only hope that the tentative survey I present will enable readers to recognize what I would call genuine constructivism when they find it in the contemporary literature.

Acknowledgments

All I have done and written was driven by the wish to acquire an attitude my parents had made me see: to follow clear thinking rather than dogmas, and to be loyal to people rather than nations. Their example was a wonderful gift.
As to the present, I want to acknowledge the loving support and encouragement I got from Charlotte, my wife. Her help should be appreciated by
the readers of this book, because it was she who frequently reminded me of
Wittgenstein's famous precept 'Everything that can be said, can be said clearly';
and it was she who saw to it that my sentences became shorter. I am deeply indebted to the University of Georgia for having offered me,
twenty-five years ago, an academic position though I did not have the usual
qualification of a Ph.D. Working with colleagues in the Department of Psychology widened my horizon, and the intensive interaction with graduate
students was invaluable in refining my ideas. I thank Jack Lochhead for having offered me a place in his Institute after
I retired from Georgia, for his unwavering friendship and support, and for the many times he pointed out conceptual jumps in my writings.
I also want to thank all those who took my work seriously and wrote about it with understanding especially Siegfried Schmidt in the Germanspeaking world, Felice Accame in Italy, Jean-Louis Le Moigne in France, and Jacques Desautels and Marie Larochelle in Canada. That I have benefited from stimulation, help, and support from many others should become clear in
Chapter 1. With regard to this book, I am grateful to Paul Ernest and Falmer Press
for having suggested that I write it. I have tried to live up to their expectations. If I were a little younger, I would take another year to iron out the creases. As it is, I hope it will stimulate readers to think along the lines suggested and to plug the gaps I am sure they will find.

Chapter 1
Growing up Constructivist: Languages and Thoughtful People
What is radical constructivism? It is an unconventional approach to the problems of knowledge and knowing. It starts from the assumption that knowledge, no matter how it be defined, is in the heads of persons, and that the thinking subject has no alternative but to construct what he or she knows on the basis of his or her own experience. What we make of experience constitutes the only world we consciously live in. It can be sorted into many kinds, such as things, self, others, and so on. But all kinds of experience are essentially subjective, and though I may find reasons to believe that my experience may not be unlike yours, I have no way of knowing that it is the same. The experience and interpretation of language are no exception.
Taken seriously, this is a profoundly shocking view. Some critics say that the emphasis on subjectivity is tantamount to solipsism (the view that nothing exists outside peoples' heads), because, they seem to think, it implies that individuals are free to construct whatever realities they like; others claim that the constructivist approach is absurd, because it disregards the role of society and social interaction in the development of an individual's knowledge. Both objections are unwarranted, and the later sections of this book will present formal arguments to demonstrate it.
I have mentioned the feature of subjectivity here at the outset, because I believe that the best way of providing an introduction to radical constructivism is to tell how I, as an individual subject, came to embrace it as a general orientation.
The beginning of this story, inevitably, has to do with my life and the roots of my dissatisfaction with traditional theories of knowledge. It will be a chronicle of gathering ideas from people I met and authors I read, none of whom, I suspect, would wholly agree with how I interpreted them and built up my model. Hence I want to preface my account with two explicit warnings.
The first is that everything expressed in this book is simply this author's view. It is an attempt to explain a way of thinking and makes no claim to des,' ibc an independent reality. That is why I prefer to call it an approach to or a theory of knowing. Though I have used them in the past, I now try to avoid the terms 'epistemology' or 'theory of knowledge' for constructivism,
1

because they tend to imply the traditional scenario according to which novice subjects are born into a ready-made world, which they must try to discover and 'represent' to themselves. From the zonstructivist point of view, the subject cannot transcend the limits of individual experience. This condition, however, by no means eliminates the influence and the shaping effects of social interaction.
The second warning concerns my memories and the act of remembering generally. As the Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico (1744-1961) remarked, we cannot reconstruct the past exactly as it was, because we cannot avoid frafning and understanding our recollections in terms of the concepts we have at present. Independently, two centuries later, Jean Piaget came to the same conclusion (1968). The story I am going to tell of my journey to constructivism, therefore, is the story as I see it now.
Which Language Tells It 'as It Is'?
Problems with the notion of reality cropped up early in my life because I grew up with more than one language. My parents were Austrians, and at home they normally spoke German. But up to the end of the first World War my father had been in the diplomatic service and he and my mother got very used to speaking English. When I was little, they would switch to English whenever they wanted to speak of things they thought unsuitable for a child and there were more things of that kind then than now. For me, of course, this was a powerful incentive to get into that secret language as quickly as possible, and when I started repeating words and phrases I picked up from them, they could not resist correcting my imitations and helping me to learn English. As a result, I felt pretty much at home in both languages by the time I was about six years old.
When Czechoslovakia was created as an independent state after the first World War, my father, whose original home and property were in Prague, automatically became a Czech citizen (and so did my mother and I). He no longer could nor wanted to be an Austrian diplomat. He devoted himself to photography and settled in the South Tyrol, the part of Austria that had become Italy after 1918. There I occasionally played with Italian children and the elementary school I was eventually sent to, was half German, half Italian. Without trouble and almost without noticing it, I learned a third language. Because my mother was a great skier and mostly took me along into the mountains and when she competed in races, I effortlessly learned to ski and it became very much part of my early life.
At the age of ten, I was sent to Zuoz, a very international boarding
school in Switzerland, where I got daily practice in all three languages. For the next eight years I was also taught French. Slowly I began to realize that learning a language in a school room was a different thing from learning a language in your every-day environment. The teacher explained what the
2
9ta

Growing up Constructivist: Languages and Thoughtful People
French words meant in the language we all knew (which happened to be German). He showed us how to pronounce them and explained the rules of grammar we needed to make sentences. Then we read French texts and learned to translate them. How we understood the words and the texts, therefore, was largely in terms of experiences we had had elsewhere. Thus the French we learned was grafted on the language we had grown up with. This was quite different from growing into a language by interacting with people who live in it day in and day out.
When we started to read Balzac and Maupassant and Anatole France, it dawned on us perhaps because our teacher was a master at circumscribing what could not be translated that to get into another language required something beyond merely learning a different vocabulary and a different grammar. It required another way of seeing, feeling, and ultimately another way of conceptualizing experience.
This was no more than a dim notion then, but it persisted because, after I had graduated from high school, it helped to make the multilingual world in which I lived a good deal more intelligible and congenial. Ingenuously and certainly without formulating it, I had stumbled on a way of thinking which, as 1 discovered some twenty years later, was the core of the well-known Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Put in the simplest way, this hypothesis states that how people see and speak of their world is to a large extent determined by their mother tongue (Whorf, 1956). In retrospect, I think, it was my firsthand experience of this phenomenon that prompted my interest in epistemology. If language had something to do with the structure of my experience and therefore to some extent with the world that I considered to be real, I could not for long avoid asking the question, what the real reality behind my languages might be like and how one could know and describe it.
The Wrong Time in Vienna
From high school I went on to study mathematics, which I had always liked perhaps because it seemed the only subject that did not depend on a natural
language. I entered Zurich University. but after one semester my father told me that Swiss Francs were no longer available and if I wanted to continue my studies it would have to be in Vienna. I was not enthusiastic about this move, but I went there in the autumn of 1936. The Austrian Nazi movement, although officially forbidden, was making itself felt everywhere, including the corridors and lecture halls of the universities. It was a depressing atmosphere, and when, before the end of the second semester, I was offered the opportunity of a winter in Australia as ski instructor, I jumped at it.
As it turned out, this was to be the end of my academic education. But Vienna had introduced me to two authors that influenced me profoundly: Freud and Wittgenstein. Freud's work (especially his Interpretation of Dreams. 8th edition, 1930) suggested that one could try to devise a rational model of
3
4°

Radical Constructivism
the workings of individual minds; and his method required that the analysis of what individuals had unconsciously implemented in their own minds always had to be brought forth by the individuals themselves. (Freud himself seems to have forgotten this principle in some later writings and many professional psychoanalysts disregarded it altogether.)
Wittgenstein's Tractatus (2nd printing, 1933) captivated me above all because of the elegant neatness of his exposition. It seemed convincing, even if I did not altogether understand it. During the years that followed I reread the book several times, and one day woke from the spell, when I came to proposition 2.223:
In order to discover whether the picture is true or false we must compare it with reality. (Wittgenstein, 1933)
It suddenly struck me that this comparison was not possible. In order to make it, one needed to have direct access to a reality that lay beyond one's experience and remained untouched by one's 'pictures' and their linguistic formulations. I felt that there were things one could say and believe to be true in one language, and yet one could not translate them into another. There seemed to be no way of showing their truth outside the context of experience in the particular language. I put away the Tractatus, and began to look elsewhere. (Many years later, when I read it once more, I realized that there was much in it that I had not understood.)
Growing Roots in Dublin
A few months before Hitler started the war, Isabel, my wife, and I were in Dublin. She was British, and when my Czech passport expired, I was able to obtain a 'stateless' alien's permit. This allowed us to stay. It did not make me eligible for a regular job, but I could do freelance work or work on a farm. With a friend I had made in Dublin we invested what money we had in a small farm in County Wicklow. He had been trained as a farmer and I was fit enough to do field work. Walking behind horses with a plough or a harrow was wonderful work for me: most of the day it leaves you free to think.
After Wittgenstein, I had read Joad's Guide to Philosophy (1936) and some Bertrand Russell, and there was lots to think about. And then I had the good fortune to make friends with Gordon Glenavy and Ned Sheehy, two amateur philosophers who had studied Berkeley and interpreted him in a way that made very good sense to me.
Berkeley's famous dictum esse est percipi has usually been taken as an ontological statement, i.e., a statement about the nature of reality. According to this view, he was saying that being perceived generates the existence of things. If this had been his intention, the many quips made by his critics would be quite justified and one could conclude that it was indeed absurd to
4
21

Growing up Constructivist Languages and Thoughtful People
hold that a tree in the forest falls and makes a noise only if someone sees and hears it fall. But there are reasons to believe that he did not intend to say this. First of all, he wrote the Latin phrase at the very beginning (paragraph 3 of 156) of a treatise to which he gave the title: Of the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710). He was not a sloppy author who picked his titles thoughtlessly. If he chose this one, he intended to write about human knowledge, not about ontology. Second, he explicitly laid out what he meant by the Latin
slogan:
The table I write on I say exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I were out of my study I should say it existed meaning thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it, or that some other spirit actually does perceive it. (Berkeley, 1710)
And Berkeley adds a general explanation:
There was an odour, that is, it was smelt; there was a sound, that is, it was heard; a colour or figure, and it was perceived by sight or touch. This is all that I can understand by these and the like expressions. For as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things Without any relation to their being perceived, that seems perfectly unintelligible. (ibid., Fart I, par.3)
He is, in fact, defining the way he, Berkeley, wants to use the words esse (to be), `to exist', and 'existence', when he is concerned with human knowledge. He also asserts that, for him, the term 'existence' has no intelligible meaning beyond the domain of experience.
His ontology is a different matter. He was a believing Christian (so much so that he became a bishop) and he therefore based his ontology on revelation, not on rational knowledge. To make it jibe with his theory of knowing, he added a mystical detail: because God perceives all things all the time, their permanence is assured. But this permanence belongs to the domain of metaphysics, not to the study of rational human knowledge. (There is a great deal more I gathered from Berkeley throughout the years and his name will crop up in later sections of this book.)
In 1939 Finnegans Wake was published and, although Joyce had lived in self-imposed exile for about two decades, the event was celebrated like no other in Dublin's intellectual circles. An informal group was formed of people who knew other languages, to try and unravel some of the countless puns that make up Joyce's extraordinary text. The group lasted through two meetings during which we covered the first three pages, but then our enthusiasm as well as the supply of Irish Whiskey dried up. In the opening lines of Finnegans Wake, however, there is the first of many oblique references to Vico, a name I had never heard before. I was told that Giambattista Vico was an eighteenthcentury philosopher in Naples. If Joyce had chosen him as one of the threads
5

in his work, I thought, he must be worth reading. I discovered that the Public Library in Dublin had an early Italian edition of Vico's Principz di scienza nuova (1744), and the next few times I could steal away from the farm, I went there to read it.
Vico's notions that we can rationally know only what we ourselves have made, and that the knowledge of poets and myth-makers is of a different kind, fitted well between some of the disconnected ideas in my head. Only very much later did I come to read Vico's treatise on epistemology (1710), which, as far as I know, is a first explicit formulation of constructivism (see Chapter 2).
Interdisciplinary Education
Shortly after the war ended, my farming friend fell in love with a British visitor and wanted to follow her to England. Isabel and I had loved Dublin and the life on the land, but the desire to return to a drier, sunnier climate had grown as we developed the first symptoms of rheumatism. We sold the farm, and after I had acquired Irish citizenship, I once again had a valid passport and was free to travel. We managed to start up my old car that had been mouldering in a shed for six years, packed our books arid our two-year old daughter, and left for Paris, Switzerland, and eventually Merano, my former home in Northern Italy. Though we had planned to return to Ireland, we postponed it when, by a fortunate accident, I met Silvio Ceccato. This meeting, more than any other event, determined the future course of my life.
Ceccato had studied music, composed an opera that had been performed, and become intensely interested in the literature on aesthetics. He found no illuminating answers and went on to spend some twenty years reading philosophy. When we met, he had concluded that there was something basically wrong with the traditional approach and that a different way could be found. He had a fairly clear idea what this way would be, and he assembled a group of interested friends to work it out. He called the group `The Italian Operationist School' and they were then in the process of developing a new theory of semantics. The group comprised a logician, a linguist, a psychologist, a physicist, an engineer, and one of the first computer buffs in Italy.' None of them was fluent in anything but Italian, and when Ceccato discovered that I spoke four languages and had congenial interests, he asked me to join the group. Since he had explained that they were trying to reduce all linguistic meaning, not to other words, but to `mental operations', I was immediately hooked.
The idea to define concepts in terms of operations stemmed from Percy Bridgman, the American Nobel-prize physicist, who had developed it in the context of analysing key-concepts in Einstein's theory of relativity (Bridgman, 1927). Unfortunately, Bridgman's `Operationalism' was appropriated by the behaviourist movement in psychology and criticized by philosophers on the
6

Growing up Constructivist: Languages and Thoughtful People
basis of excerpts that focused on the physical operations of measurement. What Bridgman had said about the mental construction of concepts was generally disregarded. For me, the thesis that words stand for concepts and that definitions should specify the operations one has to carry out to build up these concepts, fitted nicely with Vico's principle of the construction of knowledge.
During the following years, my apprenticeship in Ceccato's group, which met informally two or three times a year for a few days of intensive discussion, taught me to question all conventional ideas and the tacit assumptions in the traditional theories of knowledge. In 1949 Ceccato founded Methodos, an international journal on language analysis and logic, and I was asked to translate Italian and German contributions into English.' The pay was miserable, but it was a unique opportunity and I was able to earn most of my living as a journalist.
When Ceccato gave me his article for the first issue of Methodos to translate into English, I had no idea how difficult this would be. He had written a parody that presented the history of epistemology as a game, not unlike poker, in which the great philosophers of the western world were the players. The goal was to establish a fundamental value, but it was forbidden to agree on it at the outset. Each player, therefore, had to introduce his own choice surreptitiously and, if he was skilful, make it seem necessary and selfevident at the end (Ceccato, 1949).
Today, I cannot read my translation without embarrassment: there were allusions I did not understand and much of the irony passed me by. In time, however, the continuous contact with the journal widened my philosophical horizon and translating was the best possible training in the use of words.
A Close Look at Meanings
In 1955 Colin Cherry invited Ceccato to the third London Symposium on Information Theory and encouraged him to apply the results of his operational analyses to machine translation, a field of research that had recently sprung up. At the time the United States military commands were said to employ a large army of translators to keep up with scientific, technical and other information that was published in Russia, and they hoped machines would help to cut the waiting time.
By then Ceccato was lecturer in philosophy at the University of Milan. It was said that he received the appointment because some of his publications provided arguments against communism. However, when someone realized that the same arguments could be used against any dogma, including that of the Church, students were no longer advised to go to his lectures. The lectureship, however, enabled Ceccato to create the first Centre for Cybernetics within the framework of the University, and a proposal for research on machine translation could be submitted to the US Air Force (Ceccato, 1960). The proposal was accepted and, for the first time, Ceccato was able to pay people to work with him. In 1959 I became a full-time research assistant at the centre.

My first major task was to provide an analysis of the concepts that English and other languages, including Russian, express by means of prepositions (I had two native speakers of Russian to work with). It was a bottomless subject and it occupied me long after the Milan project had come to an end (Glasersfeld, 1965). To begin to see the complexity of the problem, one need only ask, for instance, what conceptual relation, say, the word 'by' indicates in the following expressions:
He opened the box by brute force; She spent an hour by the river; This time we came by the fields; I tried to read her letter by moonlight; Have this ready by Friday! My doctor swears by vitamin C.
And there are other relations that had to be distinguished in a detailed analysis, because in each of the languages that concerned us one needed a variety of expressions to translate the English 'by'. Since this is a question of conceptual relations, it demonstrates that different languages determine different conceptualizations.
Working in this area (in which there are countless examples of conceptual discrepancies between nouns, verbs, and adjectives that are given as equivalent in bilingual dictionaries) confirmed my deep feeling that each language entails a conceptually different world. Translation, in the sense of rendering in the second language the identical conceptual structure that was expressed in the first, was impossible, and our conceptual analyses demonstrated why.
Of course, there is a great deal of practical overlap because the differences are often very subtle and seem irrelevant in ordinary experiential situations. What we call communication works well enough whether an English girl says 'I like that boy', or an Italian 'questo ragazzo mi place' it does not seem to matter that the one expression assigns the active role to the girl, the other to the boy. But it does show that the speakers' worlds are conceptualized differently.
The American Connection
After Ceccato's project had come to an end, another US Air Force research office became interested in the type of conceptual analysis we had been doing and decided to finance a more modest effort which I directed at the Milan Institute for Documentation. They desperately needed translators and shared the hope that computers would soon be able to .help with that job. Our project monitor was Rowena Swanson, and it was she who first brought me into contact with Warren McCulloch, HP n? von Foerster, and Gordon Pask, the leaders in the new field of cybernetics. Though Dr Swanson herself was
8

Growing up Constructivist: Languages and Thoughtful People
not a scientist by training, she had the most remarkable understanding of the process of scientific research and the value of interdisciplinary connections. Her office became something of a clearing house for novel ideas and her policy of bringing together the people whose work she sponsored provided invaluable stimulation to everyone concerned.
In the following two years Piero Pisani, jehane Barton, and I worked out a novel approach to the analysis of the meaning of sentences by computer (Glasersfeld and Barton Burns, 1962). Because the large machines in those days were few and rarely accessible, we represented our system on some 120 square feet of plywood on the wall of our office and simulated the computer's basic operations (reading, comparing, and writing symbols) by moving an army of drawing pins by hand. It was an incredibly slow procedure but had the advantage of making immediately visible any inconsistencies or bugs in the programme we were designing.
Then, in 1965, the Washington office told us that there would be no more money for our kind of research in Italy, but they would continue to finance us if we came to the United States. It was a difficult choice. None of my colleagues had been to America, nor had they ever considered leaving Europe. But we did want to go on with the project, and in the end we decided to make the jump. We arrived in Athens, Georgia, towards the end
of 1966. In the spring of 1969, Isabel, with whom I had shared life for more than
three decades, died of an embolism, suddenly, without the slightest warning. It took me several days to grasp that the world I had taken for granted was gone. I began to realize that the notion that we construct our reality is not just an intellectual gambit. The reality we had built and sustained together was falling apart without her. The only thing that kept me going during the year that followed was work. And then Charlotte came along, agreed to marry me, and bit by bit we set out to build a new world.
And then there was another unexpected break with the past. At the end of 1969, Mr Nixon wiped out the Air Force Office that had been sponsoring us as well as some twenty other research projects in computer science and communication. It was then that, like the Good Fairy, the University of Georgia, where we had a contract with the Computer Centre, stepped in and adopted all of us. Brian Dutton, who had replaced Jehane Barton and whose Ph.D was actually in medieval Spanish poetry, slipped into the Romance Languages Department; Piero Pisani was snapped up by the Computer Center; and I was taken in by the Department of Psychology. So began a never contemplated life in academia.
Introduction to Psychology
Two members of the Department, who differed from their largely behaviourist colleagues, had some sympathy for my ideas about language and most
9

Radical Constructivism
generously helper' -,e by letting me sit in on their courses. One was Bob Pollack, who just then (1969) had edited a book of Alfred Binet's research papers that showed the French author as a psychologist of far greater depth than the 'Binet Scale of Intelligence' might lead one to believe; the other was Charles Smock, a developmentalist who had been trained for some time in
Geneva.
To keep up with Pollack's course, I had to read a lot on perception, because this was his specialty. As I had never thought about the mechanics of seeing, I learned a lot about the models current in psychology. On the one hand, I found them fascinating because of the ingenious experiments that provided the data with which the models could be 'confirmed'. On the other, I was amazed at the general lack of epistemological considerations. What the eye sees light, colour, and shape was usually taken for granted as a
physical given, and the research focused on the sensory mechanisms that could convey a presumed reality to the brain. No one seemed to doubt the assumption that Wittgenstein had expressed so succinctly in' his proposition 2.223 (see above). The aim of the experiments was always to discover how the eye manages to see what is there, as though to perceive were simply to receive something that exists ready-made. The naive metaphor of the photographic camera seemed to dominate the field, in spite of the fact that the scene in front of a camera, as well as the picture that comes out of it, are obviously a product of the very perceptual processes they were studying.
I did, however, come across one spectacular exception: the perceptual oddity experts occasionally referred to as the 'Cocktail Party Effect'. This is a phenomenon we all are familiar with, without having studied psychology. It can happen anywhere. You have been buttonholed by someone who is telling a boring story. Suddenly you become aware of a much more interesting conversation that is going on behind you. You don't want to offend the bore, so you follow what he says, but just enough to be able to make an encouraging noise whenever he pauses to catch his breath. 'The main part of your attention is on what is being said behind you. This means that you are able to switch your attention at will to different points in your auditory field. It is not a question of one stimulus being more 'salient' than another, because the speech of your boring companion is louder and clearer than the dim conversation of the people you don't see. It is obviously a question of your subjective interest.
I was fascinated by this and discovered that famous experimental psychologists, such as Donald Hebb, Karl Lashley, Wolfgang Kohler, and the Russians Zinchenko and Vergiles, had independently noticed and experimentally demonstrated the same phenomenon in the visual field. It struck me as a truly revolutionary fact, yet none of the psychology textbooks that I came to see during the following years mentioned it. I shall return to the mobility of attention later (see Chapter 9), but here is how Kohler (1951) described one of his results:

10

When two objects are given simultaneously in different places while the eyes do not move, we can compare these objects, and say whether they have the same shape. (Kohler, 1951, p.96)
In other words, we can see objects that are in different parts of our visual field and, without moving our eyes, compare one with the other. Our attention obviously has the power to move within the visual field just as it can move among and select from speech sounds that arrive at the same time. Indeed, in the visual field we do this quite often, for instance when our eyes are fixed on the computer screen and at the same time we notice that someone we know has walked past the window beside our desk.
For me the realization of this capability was an enormous encouragement to pursue the search for the active element in the perceiver and, ultimately, the builder of knowledge.

Collaboration with a Chimpanzee
That the University of Georgia adopted me as a psychologist was due to the fact that my interest and work in computational linguistics happened to fit into an empty slot in that department. Once more a lucky coincidence with this move led me into a venture that was as fascinating as it was unexpected. Ray Carpenter, one of the leading primatologists in the United States had joint appointments at the University of Georgia and the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta. Just at that time, the first reports on the chimpanzee Washoe, who was learning sign language, had been published by the Gardners at the University of Nevada. The discussion about whether or not a chimpanzee could acquire a language became heated and spread far beyond the specialized journals. The Yerkes Institute wanted to join the fray and planned to set up experiments that could provide more rigorous tests than the subjective evaluation of fleeting exchanges of hand signs. Ray Carpenter promoted the idea of creating a communication system consisting of keyboards and a computer that could record all interactions. When he heard of our work in computerized language analysis, he asked me whether I would be interested in designing the language and computer components of the system planned at the Yerkes Center. I talked it over with my computer colleague Piero Pisani, and we decided to go ahead.
I designed the 'Yerkish' language, using geometric designs as symbols for words (concepts) and a simplified but very strict grammar to govern their formation into sentences. By sequentially pressing keys of the key boards, code signals standing for words were sent to the computer, which contained the vocabulary, the grammar, our system for checking the correctness of sentences, and the rules for responding to some two dozen requests the chimpanzee Lana was to formulate in Yerkish word symbols. Pisani achieved the

28

miracle of fitting all this into the minute memory of a PDP computer
(Glasersfeld, 1977; Pisani, 1977).3 For six years we worked with the primatologists and the technicians of
the Yerkes Center and the accomplishments of the chimpanzee Lana caught the attention of the press and TV. It was indeed absorbing and enjoyable work. But then there came a point when we resigned from the project, because irreconcilable differences had arisen regarding the direction of the research which remained firmly embedded in the behaviourist tradition. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that I owe whatever reputation I have gained in the field of psychology to the remarkable talents of Lana.
My background in conceptual analysis, however, bore another fruit. Michael Tomasello, one of the students whose master's thesis and dissertation I had the pleasure of directing, undertook the gigantic task of recording and analysing, together with his wife, all ..k first linguistic manifestations of their daughter during the second year of her life. To my knowledge, it constitutes the only complete database of early language acquisition, and it has proven a gold mine for the development and testing of theories in that area. It was an invaluable opportunity to see just how useful Ceccato's approach to the construction of concepts that we had further developed and expanded in our computer procedures would be in the analysis of children's conceptual development. Tomasello's recent book on a central topic of language acquisition,
First Verbs: A case study of early grammatical developnent (1992), may well turn
out to be a landmark.
Discovering Piaget
To the late Charles Smock, whom I remember with much affection, I owe my introduction to the work of Jean Piaget. It seems ironic that I should have had to come to America and to lose my research job in order to be introduced to the author who was to influence my later thinking more than any other. One evening, in one of the many long talks I had with Charles about language and epistemology, he said: 'It's funny, quite a few of the things you say I have heard from Piaget.' So I began reading Piaget and since Charles had a large collection of texts he had acquired in Geneva, I read Piaget in French.
In the years that followed, when I came to teach courses on Piaget to students who could read only English, I realized how difficult, if not impossible, it is to understand the Piagetian orientation from translations. With very few exceptions (e.g., Wolfe Mays or Eleanor Duckworth) the translators seem to have a naive (i.e., naive realist) theory of knowledge and unconsciously bend what they read in Piaget's original texts to fit their own view of the world. As they cannot do this with everything, their translations often convey ideas that are incompatible with Piaget's theory or are downright incomprehensible.'
One example that might be of interest to mathematics educators is the
12

Growing up Constructivist Languages and Thoughtful People
translation of Piaget's book The Child's Conception of Number (1952a). There is first of all the inexplicable omission, on the cover and elsewhere, of the second author's name, Professor Alina Szeminska (Warsaw University), of whom Piaget says in his foreword that it was her talent that made possible the development of the particular methods of analysis used in the work. Then there is the recurrent mistranslation of individual terms, e.g., 'graduation' instead of gradation, 'equating' instead of equalizing. Most serious, given the topic of number, is the translators' indiscriminate use of the word 'set' for the French expressions for collection, quantity, row, sequence, series, and others. Small wonder that English-speaking mathematicians who read the translation thought: Who is this clown who writes about number when he doesn't even know what a set is!
The reader's understanding is further sabotaged by the translators' frequent omission of explanatory phrases and sometimes whole paragraphs. The unacceptable translation of this and other volumes provided part of my motivation for trying to present Piaget's thought to English students in a less distorted fashion. The correction of mistranslations, however, was not my primary goal. Having to teach Piaget from English textbooks, my main objective was to correct some of the basic misunderstandings concerning the nature of the constructivism that forms the backbone of his 'genetic
epistemology'.
From Mental Operations to the Construction of Reality
Piaget was not the first to suggest that we construct our concepts and our picture of the world we live in, but no thinker before him had taken a developmental approach. To someone who is driven to ask about the source and validity of knowledge by circumstances of experience (in my case, the plurality of languages), it seems obvious that the best and perhaps only way to find out how knowledge is built up, would be to investigate how children do it. For traditional philosophers, of course, this would be committing an unforgivable sin, because to justify knowledge through its development rather than by a timeless logic, is what they call a 'genetic fallacy'. But Piaget was not a traditional philosopher.
In his 'La Construction du Reel chezl 'enfant (Construction of Reality in the Child) (1937/1954) he presented a model of how a basic scaffolding the conceptual structure of objects, space, time, and causality can be built up. It serves as the framework within which a coherent experiential reality can be constructed. But this construction is not free, it is inevitably constrained and limited by the concepts that constitute the scaffolding. This is one of many points of overlap with the A Theory of Personality: Psychology of Personal Constructs of George Kelly (1963), who expressed the idea in the most general way:
13
. 30

Radical Constructivism
To the living creature, then, the universe is real, but it is not inexorable unless he chooses to construe it that way. (Kelly, 1963, p.8)
Piaget himself explained what he intended by his genetic epistemology:
So, in sum, genetic epistemology deals with both the formation and the meaning of knowledge. We can formulate our problem in the following terms: by what means does the human mind go from a state of less sufficient knowledge to a state of higner knowledge? The decision of what is lower or less adequate knowledge, and what is higher knowledge, has of course formal and normative aspects. It is not up to psychologists to determine whether or not a certain state of knowledge is superior to another state. That decision is one for logicians or for specialists within a given realm of science. (Piaget, 1970a, pp.11-12)5
Having been prepared by Vico, Berkeley, Wittgenstein, and Ceccato, I read the quoted passage as a natural extension of a statement Piaget has repeated in many places, namely that knowledge is not a picture of the real world.
When he confronts `less sufficient' or 'less adequate' with 'higher' knowledge, he is in fact saying that the meaning or value of knowledge lies in its function; and when he says that the adequacy of knowledge must be evaluated by logicians or scientists, he is simply explaining that it must be tested for logical consistency (non-contradictoriness) and for experiential validity (e.g., in experiments).
People who are tethered to traditional epistemology seem to be able to read this passage without being shaken in their belief that the better knowledge gets, the better it must represent an ontological reality. Hence, in their writings about Piaget, be they followers or critics, they disregard that, having started as a biologist, he saw cognition as an instrument of adaptation, as a tool for fitting ourselves into the world of our experience.
Because `adaptation' and `adapted' are frequently misunderstood (see Chapter 2) and `adequate' tends to be interpreted as utilitarian, I adopted the biologists' term `viability'. Actions, concepts, and conceptual operations are viable if they fit the purposive or descriptive contexts in which we use them. Thus, in the constructivist way of thinking, the concept of viability in the domain of experience, takes the place of the traditional philosopher's concept of Truth, that was to indicate a `correct' representation of reality. This substitution, of course, does not affect the everyday concept of truth, which entails the faithful repetition or description of a prior experience..
For believers in representation, the radical change of the concept of knowledge and its relation to reality, is a tremendous shock. They immediately assume thzt giving up the representational view is tantamount to denying reality, which would indeed be a foolish thing to do. The world of our
14

Growing up Constructivist: Languages and Thoughtful People
experience, after all, is hardly ever quite as we would like it to be. But this does not preclude that we ourselves have constructed our knowledge of it.
Radical constructivism, as I said at the beginning, is a way of thinking about knowledge and the act of knowing.
Because of its breach with the philosophical tradition it was (and still is in many quarters) quite unpopular. When I first submitted papers to journals, I received innumerable rejection slips from editors, one of whom stated his objection with endearing clarity: 'Your paper would be unsuitable for our readers.'
Having come from Europe and without background in psychology, it took me some time to discover what the problem was. In 1967 and for the decade that followed, the intellectual climate that pervaded departments of psychology and linguistics in the United States was largely dominated by behaviourism. As late as 1977, Skinner reiterated: The variables of which human behaviour is a function lie in the environment' (Skinner, 1977, p.1). If one believed in that kind of determinism, there could be no room for theories of mental construction. However, the belief in environmental determinism would make sense only if one had access to an objective environment, so that one could show that a particular piece of that environment causes a particular behaviour. But what a scientist or indeed any reflective person
categorizes as his or her environment and then causally relates to observed behaviour, is always a part of that observer's domain of experience and not an independent external world.
A Decisive Friendship
The constructivist way of thinking on which I had been launched by Ceccato and Piaget obviously had no chance of making inroads upon the established dogma of the disciplines to which, I felt, it might have something to say. If Piaget himself had not succeeded in being taken seriously as a philosopher, it was clear that an obscure outsider could get nowhere. In linguistics, the work of Noam Chomsky had brilliantly turned the tables on the behaviourists. In doing so, however, he had posited the fundamental elements of language as innate, and this assumption closed the door to the constructivist approach. Psychology still bracketed the mind and proudly declared itself 'the science of behaviour'. In their textbooks, students were warned against the futility of philosophizing. Empiricism (which was usually understood as realism) was the password and the one thing I did not have was empirical data to show the usefulness of the constructivist approach.
It was a great stroke of fortune that Charles Smock brought me together with Leslie Steffe. Once more a meeting profoundly influenced my life and work. Steffe ran a Piagetian research project in the Department of Mathematics Education at the University of Georgia. When we started talking about cognitive development and conceptual analysis, we at once discovered a vast
15

Radical Constructivism
area of agreement. For me, this was not only an encouragement but it came to form the basis of a collaboration that has been a truly wonderful experience ever since.
Whenever I think of this collaboration, I remember the passage in which the Nobel laureate Sir Peter Medawar demolished the popular image of the scientist 'as a regular, straightforward, plain-thinking man of facts and calculations'. Rather, he wrote:
A scientist commands a dozen stratagems of inquiry in his approximation to the truth, and of course he has his way of going about things and more or less of the quality often described as 'professionalism' an address that includes an ability to get on with things, abetted by a sanguine expectation of success and that ability to imagine what the truth might be which Shelley believed to be cognate with a poet's imagination. (Medawar, 1984, pp.17-18)
Substitute 'viable explanation' for the word 'truth', and you have what to me is a perfect portrait of Les Steffe. In the course of the innumerable fierce arguments we had throughout the years, we gradually expanded and refined each other's thinking, struggling at times for days to formulate our ideas so that they might become acceptable to both of us. There was also John Richards, a trained philosopher, who for long stretches participated in the battle; and Paul Cobb and Patrick Thompson, both graduate students of Steffe's, lived through the gruelling months of discussion that helped to forge a plausible model of what children might be doing on their way towards a concept of number and the basic operations of arithmetic (Steffe et al., Steffe, Richards and Glasersfeld, 1978; Steffe, Thompson and Richards, 1982; Steffe, Glasersfeld, Richards, and Cobb, 1983).
Though I knew nothing about research in education and remembered little from the few semesters I had studied mathematics, there had always been in the back of my mind the idea that conceptual analysis would sooner or later have to deal with mathematical concepts. For a constructivist it was obviously impossible to think of numbers and geometrical forms as God-given. Nor could one accept the Platonic view of pure forms that float about as crystals in some mystical realm beyond experience. One would have to investigate their genesis as abstract entities in an experiential domain.
Mathematicians, from Euclid down to our time, are extremely noncommittal about the make-up of their basic concepts. Numbers are the raw material of their abstract edifices, and much the way bricklayers do with bricks, they take them for granted.' Only they themselves could throw some light on how they arrived at their elementary concepts, but given their competence, the question obviously seemed trivial to them.
The philosophers I read, though some of them said quite clearly that number is 'a thing of the mind' (see Chapter 9), were no help either, because they did not explain how this mental entity (Duld be produced. The one
16

Growing up Constructivist: Languages and Thoughtful People
exception I found was Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, who proposed that the operation that forms discrete unitary objects in our perceptual field is essentially the same that underlies the concept of 'one' and, on a subsequent level of abstraction, enables us to comprise any collection of such ones in a discrete unitary entity that we call `number' (Husserl, 1887, pp.157 68). This idea was certainly helpful and it fitted well into Piaget's theory of reflective abstraction. What was needed to substantiate it, was a domain of experience where such abstractions were likely to be made. Observing children was the answer.
Teaching Experiments
When I started working with Leslie Steffe, he was already far into the development of a method he called `teaching experiment'. It was a hybrid of Piaget's `clinical method' of interviewing children and educational research. Its goal was to establish a viable model of their constructive activities in the context of arithmetic. Steffe's approach differed in that its purpose was to create situations that would allow the investigator to observe children at work and make inferences as to how they build up specific mathematical concepts. If these concepts were abstractions from reflection rather than from sensorimotor experiences, it was clear from the outset that whatever inferences could be made about them would contain an element of conjecture. In time, however, the resulting hypothetical model achieves a high degree of plausibility and predictive usefulness.
As with all general theoretical constructs, it is difficult to apply them to specific situations, when the cognizing subject is not ourselves but a `subject' we are observing. In practice there may be observable behavioral indications, on the basis of which levels of abstraction can be determined, but making that determination is not simple. One might say that assuming something as `given' or not is exclusively the subject's business. Hence, at best an observer can make educated guesses, taking into account as does any experienced diagnostician
several indications collected over an extended period of observation. (Steffe and Glasersfeld, 1988, pp.18-19)
In the teaching experiments, there is no teaching in the conventional sense, and no curriculum. Yet many of the situations presented to the children contained arithmetical problems they might have encountered in school. What mattered, however, was not the solution but the children's untutored individual approach or, as Steffe says, the children's mathematics. The experiment proceeds, not along a fixed, preconceived plan, but the investigator has to invent it step by step according to what the child says or does. It is videotaped, and the real work takes place when the members of the team review the tapes and discuss them until they can agree on an interpretation.

It is easy to understand that reviewers of research proposals tend to be turned off when they are told that the methodology of the proposed research is the teaching experiment, but what the experiments will consist of cannot be foreseen, because it depends on the reactions of the subjects. We presume it was the quality of the publications emanating from Steffe's group (e.g., Steffe, Glasersfeld, Richards and Cobb, 1983; Steffe and Cobb, 1988) that has assured continued funding.
In the early 1970s, Piaget once more became fashionable in the United States, and this time the focus was on his constructivism rather than on the `stage theory' that had previously been emphasized. As a result, a great many authors began to profess a constructivist orientation, though they seemed unaware of the principles of Piaget's epistemological position. Especially researchers in mathematics education assimilated the notion that children gradually build up their cognitive structures (hardly a novel idea), but they disregarded the fact that Piaget had changed the concept of knowledge. Consequently, when I was teaching genetic epistemology, I wanted to distinguish my approach from what students might be reading elsewhere about versions of constructivism that seemed trivial. I called the model I had been working on 'radical' and laid out its two basic principles:
knowledge is not passively received but built up by the cognizing
subject; the function of cognition is adaptive and serves the organization of the experiential world, not the discovery of ontological reality.'
The Spreading of Constructivist Ideas
In January 1978, Heinz von Foerster and Francisco Varela organized a conference in San Francisco that bore the title The construction of realities'. It was a closed symposium that brought together some thirty authors and scientists from a variety of disciplines who had in some way documented their belief that knowledge could not be found or discovered ready-made but had to be constructed.
It was a remarkable experience to learn that there were accomplished and widely respected thinkers in biology, sociology, political science, logic, linguistics, anthropology, and psychotherapy, who had in individually quite different ways come to the conclusion that the traditional epistemology could no longer be maintained. But, as so often in meetings of highly original minds, most of the time was spent on arguing about relatively small individual discrepancies, and very little on trying to formulate basic constructivist principles on which, it seemed, most if not all could have agreed.
For me, nevertheless, it was a most encouraging event. It was my only meeting with Gregory Bateson, and to listen to his comments and his wonderfully gentle way of pointing out a contradiction in a speaker's presenta-
18

tion was as important a lesson as the many insights he had provided in his writings.
It was also at this symposium that I met Paul Watzlawick, whose charming little book How Real is Real? (1977) I had shortly before used in a course of mine. Apart from being of Austrian origin, we had another thing in common: we had both lived and were still living in several languages. In many ways this liberation from a single mother tongue facilitates an immediate understanding of certain aspects of constructivism that take hard work and reasoning in all whose world view is constrained by a single language. Paul Watzlawick then invited me to write the introductory essay in his The invented reality (German edition, 1981; English, 1984), a book that has done more than any other to spread constructivist ideas.
Apart from my immeasurable debt to Leslie Steffe, I owe a great deal to the graduate students who worked with him and to those who took my courses in the Psychology Department. They were a motley lot, because many of them did not come from my department but from philosophy, linguistics, and mathematics education. Compared to one's peers colleagues on the faculty and researchers who listen to presentations at professional meetings graduate students are less inhibited. They tend to ask questions when what is said does not make sense to them. Thus they often put their finger on unconscious, unwarranted jumps in the development of ideas and inconsistencies in the presentation. No doubt this is of help to researchers in all disciplines. In the area of constructivism it is downright invaluable for a quite specific reason. I have often said that adopting the constructivist orientation requires the modification of almost all one has thought before. This is laborious and difficult to carry through. We are usually quite unaware of many habitual patterns of thinking in our minds. And there is another obstacle: the language in which our thoughts have to be formulated, be it English, Italian, or any other natural language, has been shaped by the naive realism inherent in the business of practical living and by a few prophets who were convinced to have access to an absolute reality.
For the very reason that radical constructivism entails a radical rebuilding of the concepts of knowledge, truth, communication, and understanding, it cannot be assimilated to any traditional epistemology. Above all, it seems enormously difficult to appreciate that it is not an orientation that claims to reveal an ultimate picture of the world. It claims to he no more than a coherent way of thinking that helps to deal with the fundamentally inexplicable world of our experience and, most important perhaps, places the responsibility for actions and thoughts where it belongs: on the individual thinker.
Retirement and a New Beginning
At the 1975 meeting of the Jean Piaget Society in Philadelphia, I for the first time presented the radical interpretation of genetic epistemology to a larger
19

public As it was a plenary session, there was not much discussion. But it had two important consequences for me. Hermine Sinclair, a long-time collaborator of Piaget, vigorously encouraged me to go on with my work, and it is to her that I owe my first invitation to Geneva. The presentation also led to a long talk with Jack Lochhead who was in the process of starting a Piagetian research group on cognition in the Physics Department of the University of Massachusetts. In the years that followed he invited me several times to give workshops on conceptual analysis, because he and his colleagues were trying to develop a more effective way of teaching physics and the mathematics it requires. Like other educational researchers, they had noticed that many students, were quite able to learn the necessary formulas and apply them to the limited range of textbook and test situations, but when faced with novel problems, they fell short and showed that they were far from having understood the relevant concepts and conceptual relations that constitute the actual framework of physics.
When I retired from the University of Georgia in 1987, Jack Lochhead called and said, why don't you come and work with us? By then his group had been established as an independent institute of the University at Amherst. The research in physics education, the modest title 'Scientific Reasoning Research Institute', the promise of snow and skiing in Massachusetts, and the fact that Charlotte's children would be much closer there, proved irresistible.
Work in the Institute soon made clear to me that teaching physics was not quite the same as teaching arithmetic in the elementary grades. Although the fundamental concepts in both areas are abstract constructs, their use is markedly different. In mathematics, concepts can be combined and related in all the ways the mathematician deems legitimate within the rules he has accepted; and new abstractions from such compounds may yield new levels of operating. If some of the resulting abstract structures are found to be applicable to worldly problems, this may be gratifying to their inventor but it is irrelevant to the pursuit of mathematics. In physics, however, the process of abstraction is doubly constrained. Not only must it comply with logic and be conceptually coherent, but its results must also withstand experimental tests, that is to say, they must fit experiential situations. In short, mathematics is self-sufficient and its goals lie within its own domain. Physics, in contrast, has an instrumental component, in that it has to provide theoretical models that help to organize our experiential world.
Support from Physics and Philosophy of Science
Although the problems that made up the daily work at the Institute were usually concerned with high-school physics and did not involve relativity or quantum theory, i had the opportunity to sit in on colloquia and meetings where such topics were discussed. Much of what I heard there seemed to confirm that it had not been misinterpretation, when years before I had picked

a quotation here and there from the writings of the great physicists in our century. They all have at some point made statements that indicate they were aware of inventing or constructing theory rather than having it forced upon them by a collection of data. Werner Heisenberg, for instance, wrote:

In the natural sciences, then, the object of research is no longer nature as such, but a nature confronted by human questions, and in this sense, here too, man encounters himself. (Heisenberg, 1955, p.18)

For the constructivist, such statements are a welcome corroboration, even if the same physicists, in their day-to-day work adopted a far more realist
stance.' It is not at all surprising that a problem-solver takes for real the problematic experiential situation with which he is struggling. His task is
technical, it lies within a specific, circumscribed area of experience, and its solution would not be advanced by epistemological considerations.' Only when he has solved it, may he adopt a philosophical attitude and conclude that his solution is an instrument for the organization and 'explanation' of experience
rather than a representation of reality. From the outset, it was clear that, in developing the constructivist
approach to knowledge, the philosophy of science was an area that could not be skirted. Among my eclectic readings, one author in particular provided
an irresistible challenge. Karl Popper (1968) gave an excellent description of the instrumentalist
view of science and then attempted to show that it was logically flawed. An attentive reader, however, will notice that his refutation is ultimately based on nothing but his metaphysical belief that scientific theories can approximate a rightness ('truth') that lies beyond the level of instrumental viability in given situations. The cornerstone of this belief are his notions of falsifiability and crucial tests. He claims that the fact that 'Newton's theory was falsified by crucial experiments which failed to falsify Einstein's' means more than that it broke down under certain experiential circumstances. Instrumentalism, he says, has nothing equivalent to such tests.

An instrument may break down, to be sure, or it may become outmoded. But it hardly makes sense to say that we submit an instrument to the severest tests we can design in order to reject it if it does not stand up to them: every air frame, for example, can be 'tested to destruction', but this severe test is undertaken not in order to reject every frame -dim it is destroyed but to obtain information about the frame (i.e. co test a theory about it), so that it may be used within the
limits of i!s applicability (or safety). For :nstrumental purposes of practical application a theory may

turned out to be false will not hesitate to apply its formalism within the limits of its applicability . . .
Instruments, even theories in so far as they are instruments, cannot be refuted. The instrumentalist interpretation will therefore be unable to account for real tests, which are attempted refutations, and will not get beyond the assertion that different theories have different ranges of application. But then it cannot possibly account for scientific progress. (Popper, 1968, pp.112-13)
On the strength of this, Popper concludes that instrumentalism is an `obscurantist philosophy' (p.113).
For me, this passage was truly illuminating. Clearly, Popper had fully understood the thrust of instrumentalism. His example of the astronomer was an accurate prediction of how the scientists and engineers of NASA went about their business when they sent a man to the moon: they calculated everything according to Newtonian formulas, because this was far simpler and less time-consuming than using Einstein's, although of course they all knew that Newton's theory of the planetary system was no longer considered to be true.
Yet, because Popper is wedded to the notion of scientific progress, he is compelled to use the term 'refutation' in two different senses. On the one hand, it is the generation of circumstances in which a theory, used as an instrument, does not procure the desired result (or, in my way of speaking, is not viable). On the other hand, it is a crucial experiment that shows the theory to be false (where 'false' is interpreted as the opposite of `true').
This is where a metaphysical belief enters the game. Indeed, Popper himself seems to have been aware that he was fudging. At the end of the chapter that is to justify his belief in the 'growth of knowledge', he writes, albeit in a footnote:
I admit that there may be a whiff of verificationism here; but this seems to me a case where we have to put up with it, ifwe do not want a whiff of some form of instrumentalism that takes theories to be mere instruments of exploration. (ibid., p.248, my emphasis)
That is the difference. Radical constructivism is uninhibitedly instrumentalist. It replaces the notion of 'truth' (as true representation of an independent reality) with the notion of 'viability' within the subjects' experiential world. Consequently it refuses all metaphysical commitments and claims to be no more than one possible model of thinking about the only world we can come to know, the world we construct as living subjects. Because this is a difficult and shocking change of attitude when one first comes to it, I want to reiterate once more that it would be misguided to ask whether radical constructivism is true or false, for it is intended, not as a metaphysical conjecture, but as a conceptual tool whose value can be gauged only by using it.

Chapter 2
Unpopular Philosophical Ideas: A History in Quotations
In the first chapter I recounted how biographical circumstances my upbringing, living in certain places, meeting a few exceptional people, and eclectic reading led me to an unconventional way of thinking. Yet, there is nothing new about the ideas that make up radical constructivism. The only novelty may be the way they have been pulled together and separated from metaphysical embroidery.
I agree with Bertrand Russell's definition:
Metaphysics, or the attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means of thought, has been developed, from the first, by the union and conflict of two very different human impulses, the one urging
men towards mysticism, the other urging them towards science . . . the greatest men who have been philosophers have felt the need both of science and of mysticism. the attempt to harmonise the two was what made their life, and what always must, for all its arduous uncertainty, make philosophy, to some minds, a greater thing than either science or religion. (Russell, 1917/1986, p.20)
However, I do not agree that to attempt such a union would be a rational undertaking. For me, whatever is truly mystical eludes the grasp of reason. This is neither a denial nor a judgment of value, it merely expresses the conviction that the mystical is a closed domain of wisdom that withers under the cutting tools of reason. The purpose of reason is analysis. Whatever reason wants to deal with must be describable in terms of specific differences and therefore has to be articulated into entities and relations. The mystical treats the world as a whole that requires no differentiation from any background. When it speaks of parts, they are metaphors intended to generate empathy with the ultimate oneness.
Radical constructivism is intended as a model of rational knowing, not as a metaphysics that attempts to describe a real world. I believe that its effort to delimit the purview of reason is one of its virtues, precisely because this limitation accentuates the need to contemplate the realm of the mystic's wisdom.
The history I shall present, therefore, is an attempt to justify this separation.

It will not be complete in any sense. In part, this is because I am citing only those authors who seemed indispensable to me and others could have been included to strengthen particular points; in part, it will be incomplete because there are authors (e.g., Collingwood, Dewey, and Peirce) who undoubtedly said related things, but whom I do not know well enough to discuss.

Objectivity Put in Question

Once one steps out of the philosophical tradition and questions the illusory goal of attaining true representations of a real world, quite a few thinkers can
be found who have taken a step in this direction. Most of them, however, ran into a serious problem. By renouncing the quest for certain knowledge about reality, they had deprived themselves of the very argument philosophers use to distinguish knowledge from mere opinion or belief. Consequently, these wayward thinkers were for the most disregarded in the history of philosophy and, at best, left by the wayside as oddities. The traditional way of thinking was (and still is) far too strong to be shaken by a critique that offers no
immediate replacement. In the last hundred years, the situation has begun to change. During the
nineteenth century, science was regarded as a sophisticated extension of common sense that had gradually unveiled the mysteries of the real world. The successes of technology seemed an unquestionable confirmation of realist epistemology. Then, however, came spectacular scientific developments especially in theoretical physics that engendered internal doubts in the representational character of scientific explanations. Could science unveil the character of the world as it is? The passage from Heisenberg I quoted in the preceding chapter suggests that the scientist cannot escape the human ways of seeing and thinking. Objectivity, thus, became doubtful. Towards the end of
his life, Jacob Bronowski described the changed situation:

There is no permanence to scientific concepts because they are only our interpretations of natural phenomena . . . We merely make a temporary invention which covers that part of the world accessible
to us at the moment. (Bronowski, 1978, p.96)

Today the very philosophy of science teems with ideas that subvert the millenary tradition of realism and its goal of objective knowledge. In the face of this turmoil, it may be both legitimate and appropriate to review the history
of epistemological dissent. To me, such a review is of particular interest. Not because I hope to find
many pioneers of constructivism, but rather because the record of thinkers who went against the established view, confirms the need for a radically different approach to the problems of knowing.

Radical Constructivinn
The Pre-Socratics
From the beginnings of western philosophy, there was one group of dissidents that could not be ignored. Their arguments were logically incontrovertible. They were the 'sceptics', and their first school was founded by Pyrrhon towards the end of the fourth century BC. Its teachings were assembled and annotated more than five hundred years later by Sextus Empiricus.
The sceptics collected innumerable examples to demonstrate the unreliability of the human senses, showing that perceptions and the judgments based on them were influenced by context and human attitudes and therefore could not be trusted to provide a true picture of the real world. If, for instance, you move your hand from a basin of cold water into one that is tepid, the second feels hot; if you begin with hot water, the tepid feels cold; the true temperature of the water, therefore, cannot be determined because our judgment depends on the experiential context.
The belief that true knowledge of the real world could never be attained, had actually been expressed in the most succinct way by Xenophanes, who lived some two hundred years earlier than Pyrrhon:
Certain truth [about God or the world] has not and cannot be attained by any man; for even if he should fully succeed in saying what is true, he himself could not know that it was so. (Xenophanes, Fragment 34)'
In the course of the centuries, the gist of this statement has cropped up in many forms. It has invariably been attacked by means of a spurious argument. If you deny that there can be certain knowledge, it is claimed, you cannot be certain of this denial either. The argument is spurious, because it confounds the domain of logic and mathematics with the domain of certain knowledge about the world. Xenophanes would have had no qualms about admitting the certainty of 2 + 2 = 4, because once agreement has been reached about the rules that govern counting and cn a fixed sequence of number words, everyone is obliged to arrive at 'four' whenever two pairs of items are counted in sequence. This certainty reveals something about the numbering system invented and agreed on, but it reveals nothing about God's flair for mathematics or a world of numbers supposed to be independent of the counters.
Indeed, the reasoning that underlies Xenophanes' insight involves the logic of thinking, not the particulars of experience. To cliim true knowledge of the world, you would have to be certain that the picture you compose on the basis of your perczptions and conceptions is in every respect a true representation of the world as is. really is. But in order to be certain that it is a good match, you should be able to compare the representation to what it is supposed to represent. This, however, you cannot do, because you cannot step out of your human ways of perceiving and conceiving.
About a hundred years later, Protagoras, the first of the Sophists in the fifth century BC, formulated the famous phrase:
26
43

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas. A History in Quotations
Man is the measure of all things. (Protagoras in Guthrie, 1971, p.171)
Today, we might say: a human being's view of the world is necessarily a human view. Unless you claim some form of direct mystical revelation, whatever you call knowledge your ideas or concepts, the relations that connect them, your images of yourself and the world will be human, because the way you have produced them was yours, and you, whether you like it or not, are bound by the human ways.
Al'. great philosophers of the western world have admitted the logical irrefutability of this argument. Nevertheless, they have struggled to find a way around it. In one form or another, explicitly or surreptitiously under the guise of metaphysics, they resorted to mysticism or religious revelation.
Plato was apparently aware of the paradoxical character of the concept of knowledge, and he tried to resolve it with the metaphor of a line divided in four parts (The Republic, 509d-517b). The first two segments represent the world of the senses: shadowy images of imagination and conjecture, and the forms of things we derive from perception. They are not real things, and he illustrated this by the famous parable of the cave. In this domain there is no certain knowledge but only 'opinion' (doxa). The third section holds the understanding of products of thought (episteme), such as mathematics. The fourth belongs to the eternal ideas of beauty, justice, and goodness, which are every human's heritage since God created the universe, and it is here that true wisdom may be achieved. The metaphor of the line was to suggest the possibility of development, as though one could escape from the shadows of the cave and come to see the divine Truth by the power of human reason.
Theological Insights
That there is no logical justification for such a belief in the powers of reason, was seen not only by the sceptics, but early on also by men of the Christian faith. In Byzantium, in the third century AD, a school of theology arose that later became known as `apophatic' or 'negative' theology. It formulated a powerful principle:
The absolute transcendence of God excludes any possibility of iden-
tifying Him with any human concept . . for no human word or
thought is capable of comprehending what God is. (Meyendorff, 1974, p.11)
To put it simply: if God is omnipotent, omniscient, and present everywhere at the same time, then He is different from all the things we encounter in the world we live in; and since our concepts are derived from living experience, we cannot capture the character of the divine in those concepts.
Of course, the Byzantine theologians did not deny the possibility of
27
44
tt

Radical Constructivism
revelation, but they made very clear that revelation was not to be confused with rational knowledge. The Church, that had always claimed to be the authorized interpreter of God's ways and God's will, did not appreciate this kind of theology, and declared it a heresy. But it survived, and echoes of it crop up in the writings of medieval mystics.'
Most extraordinary among them is the Irish scholar John Scottus Eriugena who was born early in the ninth century and spent much of his life in France. As a monk he was mostly concerned with theology and followed the 'negative' direction of the Byzantine fathers, but his theory of knowledge had a wider scope. He was interested in reason as such and in the kind ofknowledge it could produce. Two quotations suffice to show how modern he was. The first is an uncanny anticipation of an insight that Kant (1 believe, quite independently) formulated in the preface to his Critique of Pure Reason (1787):
For just as the wise artist produces his art from himself in himself and foresees in it the things he is to make . . . so the intellect brought forth from itself and in itself its reason, in which it foreknows and causally pre-creates all things which it desires to make. (Eriugena, feriphyseon, Vol.2, 577ab)3
The second passage from Eriugena foreshadows Descartes' famous 'cogito ergo sum' (I think, therefore 1 am) but does not encourage the vain hope that the establishment of one's own existence could serve as a basis for the attainment of certain truths about the world:
Man, like God, can know with absolute certainty that he is, but cannot circumscribe his nature so as to be able to say what he is. (Quoted in Kearney, 1985, p.97)
When the Byzantine thinkers asserted the impossibility of grasping the essential character of God by means of human concepts, they were ,k,ing theology. However, the argument that our concepts are formed on tl. basis of our experience and can therefore not be used to describe anything that lies outside our experiential field, applies not only to superhuman entities but also to any 'reality' we posit beyond the things that we experience. Eriugena then emphasized the fact that reason operates according to its own rules and cannot transcend them (see Kant, below).
Modern Science Widens The Rift
Thus, even before the year 1000 there was the suggestion that there are two different kinds of knowledge, but the division is not quite the division Plato had proposed. For him, sensory experience led to 'opinion', and reason to 'certain knowledge'. Now, we have the clear but fallible knowledge of experience and the eternal truths of mystical revelation.
28
4 ;10

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas A History in Quotations
The rift in the concept of knowledge was present but somewhat dormant through the Middle Ages (see McMullin, 1988, p.31). It became topical in the Renaissance, when Copernicus, Kepler, and Galilei proclaimed a model of the planetary system that was in direct contradiction to the teaching of the Church. Wise men like Osiander, the editor of Copernicus' posthumous work, and Cardinal Bellarmino, who wanted to help Galilei avoid a trial for heresy, tried to defuse the clash. The scientist, they said, was not committing heresy, as long as he used his theory to calculate predictions and to provide plausible models of phenomena.' The one thing he must not do, is claim that he is describing the reality of God's world, because God's world is the province of the Church and its dogma. It was the first clear assertion that the knowledge of science should be considered instrumental and fallible, whereas the mystical wisdom of revelation is unquestionable and an end in itself.
Though Galilei formally recanted, he was by no means willing to accept this partition. He did not want to give up the notion that scientific theory could describe the real world. There is a strange irony in this refusal.' Galilei is celebrated as the founder of modern science and his method has, indeed, been enormously successful. It can be characterized as a procedure that invents ideal entities whose behaviour is governed by ideal laws. These invented ideas are then used to explain the observed behaviour Li experiential items, by introducing disturbances that prevent them from obeying the ideal laws. His law of 'free fall', for instance, demands that all bodies, regardless of their weight, accelerate at the same rare when they are falling. Galilei formulated the law, although there was no way he could have experienced exactly what the law said or demonstrated it experimentally not even with the help of the leaning tower of Pisa. Nevertheless, if one added some factors representing considerations such as friction and air resistance to the ideal law, the calculations became eminently useful in a great many practical situations.
Torricelli, a famous student of Galilei's, expressed this very clearly:
Whether the principles of the doctrine de motu be true or false is of very little importance to me. Because if they are not true, one should pretend that they are true, as we supposed them to be, and then consider as geometrical and not mixed [empirical], all the other speculations that we derived from these principles .. . If this is done, I say that there will follow everything Galileo and I have said. Then, if the balls of lead, of iron, or of stone do not behave according to our computation, too bad for them, we shall say that we were not talking
of them. (Belloni, 1975, p.30)
The quoted passage would fit well into the discussions that today are enlivening the philosophy of science, discussions in which the objectivity of science and its theories is being put in question from a variety of positions. From the constructivist point of view, it is of course encouraging to find that, long before the invention of quantum theory, there were great physicists who
29

Radical Constructivism
did not quite believe, as Galilei did early on, that 'the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics', but were more inclined to think that mathematics was a rather neat human way of ordering and managing the human experience of nature.
The wide range of successful applications of the physicists' laws to puzzling problems in the field of experience, soon became the dominant factor that
empowered the knowledge of science at the expense of the mystical. Philosophers, however, could not be satisfied with practical success. Bound as they were by a tradition of 2000 years, they were concerned with absolute Truth. Scientific theories, after all, were forever changing, and their confirmation by experiments could never allay the sceptics' argument against the reality of phenomena. Philosophers required eternal truths that would point to the solution of all problems, including those posed by science. But they were not prepared to admit that a religious or mystical faith was the way to grasp those truths. They did not want to do without God, but He had to operate within human reason.
A Failure and an Achievement of Descartes
Descartes, who was profoundly disturbed by the fact that some of his contemporaries were applying the rediscovered teachings of Pyrrhon's school to religious beliefs, decided to pursue the quest for certain knowledge in an uncompromising way. By subjecting all ideas to doubt, he hoped to isolate those that could not be doubted. He found only one: he could not question that it was he who was thinking the doubts. But when he tried to use this certainty to build up other ideas that were indubitable, he failed and had to resort to an act of faith. 'Since God is no deceiver', he said, 'the faculty of knowledge that He has given us cannot be fallacious' (Popkin, 1979, p.177).
Instead of demolishing scepticism, Descartes' method of doubt had enhanced it. But he achieved a number of other things that show his genius. One of them was the invention of analytical geometry, the ingenious way of translating geometry into algebra. I was told in high school how he came to make this invention.
The story is apocryphal but of immediate appeal to constructivists. When he was 23 years old, Descartes joined an army and was moved to southern Germany. There was no war at that time and he was billeted in a peasant house. It was winter and he spent most of his time not only indoors but, as he put it, 'in a stove'. This sounds odd, but if one knows peasant houses in that region, there is no mystery. A corner of the family room is usually taken up by a large tiled stove that has a wooden structure around it and a platform above, which is large enough to stretch out, a couple of feet or so below the ceiling. It is the warmest place in the house and the flies know it. They use this part of the ceiling as a home base.
Lying on this platform, Descartes looked up at the ceiling and saw flies
30
47

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas: A History in Quotations
walk about. Having a mathematical bent, he asked himself how one could accurately describe their movements and had a flash of genius. There were two lines, formed by the meeting of the walls and the ceiling, that met in a right angle in the corner of the room. The position of a fly could be described by projecting it on both lines and measuring the respective distances of the two projections from the corner. If the fly moved in a straight line and you applied the same procedure to the endpoint of its movement, you could express the fly's itinerary by means of the distances of the first and second projections on each of the axes.
It may well have been this experience which convinced Descartes that certain knowledge, if there was any, would have to spring from reason and its most perfect embodiment, mathematics. For the constructivist, the story
whether it is true or not is a nice example of the principle that mathematical ideas can be abstracted from sensorimotor experiences.
Locke's Forgotten Reflection
In the century after Descartes, there followed one after the other, the Englishman John Locke, the Irish bishop George Berkeley, and the Scot David Hume. Together, the three philosophers later became known as the 'British Empiricists'. This designation can be found in every introductory psychology text, and it has given rise to the notion, both among teachers and students, that the three men formed a harmonious team fighting for the same ideas. This is a poor description of the trio because each of the men disagreed with his predecessor as much as with other philosophers. More serious, however, is the spurious meaning that has been attributed to the term 'empiricism'.
Empiricists agree that knowledge springs from experience and that experience is its testing ground. But on the question of how experience is to be related to a real world beyond it, they may have widely different opinions. Today, however, one often reads the expression 'hard-nosed empiricist', and it is intended to convey that experimental evidence provides data that reflects the character or the state of an observer-independent real world. None of the three British empiricists was so naive a realist.
Locke, as far as I know, was the first to use the term `reflection' with the meaning that is fundamental in cognitive constructivism since Piaget. His explanation is not the most transparent and requires some concentration:
This source of ideas every man has wholly in him-self; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external obje. yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called internal sense. But as I call the other Sensation, so I call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the
31

Radical Constructivism
mind takes of its own operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. (Locke, 1690, Book II, Chapter i, par.4)
Locke was well aware of the fact that Descartes (and Galilei) had discredited the reliability of the sensations of colour, taste, smell, etc., (secondary qualities) and he agreed that we merely
imagine that those ideas are the resemblances of something really existing in the objects themselves. (ibid., Chapter viii, par.25)
In contrast, the 'primary' qualities.
bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or rest, .. . may be
properly called real, original, or primary qualities; because they are in the things themselves, whether they are perceived or not: and upon their different modifications it is that the secondary qualities depend. (ibid., par.23)
He does not explain why he considers this less 'imagined' than the reality of the secondary qualities. Indeed, it is ironic that the father of empiricism here tacitly aligns himself with Plato's idealism and assumes that there are ideas that do not derive from experience.

The Exaggeration of the 'Blank Slate'

Much has been made of the slogan that the new-born child's mind is a 'blank slate' on which experience alone inscribes knowledge. Locke himself used expressions such as 'empty cabinet', 'white sheet', and 'waxed tablet', but in view of what he says about ideas springing from the mind's reflection upon its own operations, these metaphors are misleading (see Fraser, 1959; Vol.1; p.48). Relational notions, he says, are always the result of sensation and reflection. He explains this, for instance, in the case of cause and effect:

. finding that the substance, wood, which is a certain collection of
simple ideas so called, by the application of fire, is turned into another substance, called ashes; i.e., another complex idea, consisting of a collection of simple ideas, quite different from that complex idea which we call wood; we consider fire, in relation to ashes, as cause, and the ashes as effect. So that whatever is considered by us to conduce or operate to the producing any particular simple idea, or collection of simple ideas, . . . which did not before exist, bath thereby in our minds the relation of a cause, and so is denominated by us. (ibid., Book II, Chapter xxvi, par.])

1 his pattern of generation is repeated for several abstract concepts and it clearly involves sensation, as it starts with collections of 'simple ideas'. But it also involves the observer's reflective mind. In the quoted case it is the mind that considers the one collection to be what conduces or operates to produce the other and turns a simple sequence into the relation of cause and effect.
As far as 'understanding' is concerned, which is the main word in the title of Locke's work, the pattern of concept generation he illustrated in no way contradicts the image of the child's empty slate it merely claims that the construction of knowledge cannot begin until there are some simple sensory ideas for the mind to operate. Only then can the mind reflect and abstract new complex ideas from its own operations. It fell to Berkeley, to point out Locke's inconsistency in the treatment of primary qualities.
The myth that Locke's empiricism held all knowledge to be derived directly from the senses was greatly reinforced by the misunderstanding of his use of the term 'experience'. For him, this included not only the acquisition of sense ideas but also their retention and subsequent elaboration by means of reflection and abstraction (see Fraser, 1959; p.49).
A Reinterpretation of Berkeley
George Berkeley, the second of the British empiricists, read Locke's Essay concerning human understanding at the very beginning of the eighteenth century, when he was studying at Trinity College in Dublin. He kept a notebook, and in it the barely 20-year old philosopher recorded early formulations of ideas he was then to develop and expound in his Essay towards a new theory of vision
(1709) and the Treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge (1710).' There are also many entries that indicate agreements and disagreements with Locke.
One of the major disagreements concerns the relation between the 'primary qualities' and real things.
I believe that Berkeley's objection to the notion that these qualities are less dependent on the observer and therefore 'truer' than the secondary ones, is here derived from a consideration that he never expressed more clearly in later writings.
Extension, motion, time do each of them include the idea of succession, & so far forth they seem to be of mathematical consideration. Number consisting in succession & distinct perception also consists in succession, for things at once perceiv'd are jumbled & mixt together in the mind. Time and motion cannot be conceiv'd without succession, & extension . . . cannot be conceiv'd but as consisting of parts WI' may be distinctly and successively perceiv'd. (Berkeley, 1706, par.460)
The expression 'mathematical consideration' becomes clear if one takes into account that the quoted paragraph 460 is the answer he provides to a
33
50

Radical Constructivism
question about extension which he asked himself in the much earlier paragraph 111, as a query immediately after:
Number not in bodies, it being the creature of the mind depending entirely on its consideration & being more or less as the mind pleases. (ibid., par.110)
Berkeley was well aware that all mathematical thinking results from re-
flection and abstraction. When he realized that succession could not be a
property of sensory objects but had to be abstracted by a subject's reflection upon its own experience, he called it a mathematical notion, even where it gave rise, not to numbers, but to concepts such as extension, motion, and time. The important point in this is the realization that the features that were considered primary (in the sense that they reflect properties of real objects) depend on concepts that are formed from a succession of at least two experiential frames and an act of relating them. The succession then merely provides the experiencing subject with an opportunity to establish a relation; it does not require it. Nor does the succession itself determine what kind of relation should be established.
It is often said that Berkeley demolished the objectivity of primary qualities by showing that the arguments Locke had used against the secondary qualities were equally effective when applied to the primary ones. I would not deny this: But his insight that the elementary conceptual relations of extension, motion, time, and causation are not supplied by the mere succession of experiences, seems a far more powerful argument to me. The realization that these basic relational building blocks have to be generated by the experiencing subject, wipes out the major rational grounds for the belief that human knowledge could represent a reality that is independent of human experience. For if extension, motion, time, and causation are dependent on the reflective activity of a subject, one cannot describe in human terms what `reality' would be like before it is experienced.
Hunie's Deconstruction of Conceptual Relations
The interpretation of succession is, indeed, one of the problems that led David Hume, the third British empiricist, to his most uncompromising scepticism. He made a valiant effort to unravel how we come to impose specific relations:
Tho' it be too obvious to escape Observation, that different ideas are connected together; I do not find, that any Philosopher has attempted to enumerate or class all the Principles of Connexion; a Subject, however, that seems very worthy of Curiosity. To me, there opears to be only three Principles of Connexion among Ideas, viz. Resemblance,

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas: A History in Quotations
Contiguity in Time or Place, and Cause or Effect. (Hume, 1742, Essay
III)
He proceeds to give examples of how these 'connexions' are made and then, before concluding the Essay by once more listing the three 'principles', he says:
These loose Hints I have thrown together, in order to excite the Curiosity of Philosophers, and beget a Suspicion at least, .. . that many Operations of the human Mind depend on the Connexion or Association of Ideas, which is here explain'd. (ibid.)
Later in his work, when he discusses 'the communication of motion by impulse, as by the shock of two billiard balls' he states:
When, therefore, we say, that one Object is connected with another, we mean only, that they have acquir'd a Connexion in our thoughts, and give rise to this inference, by which they become Proofs of each other's Existence. (ibid., Essay vii, Part I)
It is crucial to remember that Locke and Hume were concerned with human understanding, Berkeley with human knowledge. All three focus primarily on how the rational mind acquires knowledge and how knowledge is constituted. When Hume, in the context of the quoted passage, speaks of `existence', it is the existence that Berkeley has defined as perceivability in the domain of experience, and not ontological being. That this interpretation is justified, becomes clear when one considers a later passage in Hume, concerning the question whether the perceptions of the senses are produced by external objects that resemble them:
How shall this Question be determin'd? By experience surely; as all other Questions of a like Nature. But here Experience is, and must be entirely silent. The Mind has never any thing present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any Experience of their Connexion with Objects. The Supposition of such a Connexion is, therefore, without any Foundation in Reasoning. (ibid., Essay xii,
Part 1)
After this, the belief that human knowledge ought to represent an absolute reality could no longer honestly be justified by reasoning about experience, but had to find support in the realn, of metaphysics.' The realization that 'relating' is under all circumstances a conceptual act and therefore requires an active mind to conceive it, was no doubt one of the factors that prompted Kant to say that Hume had shaken him out of a 'dogmatic slumber' (Kant, 1783, p.260).

Bentham and Vico

Pioneers of Conceptual Analysis

In 1780, a year before Kant published his Critique of Pure Reason. Jeremy Bentham produced a `preliminary' treatise on jurisprudence which contained first elements of his `Theory of fictions'. The theory as a whole was pieced together from a variety of writings that appeared in the last two decades of the eighteenth century and until after his death in 1832 (see Ogden, 1959; p.XXff). To my knowledge, Bentham initiated the operational analysis of concepts and thus took the first step in a direction that would later help to resolve a major problem in Kant's philosophy: the assumption of a priori categories. For Bentham, too, the concept of relation was a trigger:

No two entities of any kind can present themselves simultaneously to the mind nor can so much as the same object present itself at different times without presenting the idea of Relation.' For relation is a fictitious entity, which is produced and has place, as often
as the mind, having perception of any object, obtains, at the same,
or, at any immediately succeeding instant, perception of any other object, or even of that same object, if the perception be accompanied with the perception of its being the same: Diversity is, in the
one case, the name of the relation. Identity in the other case. (Bentham, in Ogden, 1959; p.29)

Bentham's analyses were 100 years ahead of his time (Ogden, 1959; p.cli)
and had to wait for Hans Vaihinger (see below) to be appreciated and further developed.
Far from Britain, there was another thinker in the first half of the eighteenth century whose work anticipated some of the most important ideas of constructivism. In 1710, the year of Berkeley's Treatise', Giambattista Vico
published the Latin tract De antiquissima Italorum sapientia in Naples and opened
a new perspective on epistemology. It had little resonance in Italy and, until recently, remained almost unknown in the English-speaking world. On the strength of his later work, Vico became known as a seminal thinker in the philosophy of history and sociology. His theory of knowledge pervaded all he ever wrote, but because he did not again devote a special text to it, it was mostly misinterpreted and treated as a marginal curiosity by his readers and commentators.
Vico, too, was perturbed by the inroads of scepticism on matters of religious faith and revelation, but he profoundly disagreed with Descartes. Instead of doubting everything in order to find certain truth, he wanted to separate the mystical from the rational once and for all. To do this, he first of all set out to specify what should be considered characteristic of the two domains. Second, he had the brilliant idea of examining the means by which each of them expressed its products. Language, thus, became a key factor in
his theory.

36

He opens his treatise on 'The most ancient wisdom of the inhabitants of Italy' with some etymological observations. For the speakers of Latin, he says, the words veruni (true) and factum (fact) were interchangeable,' intellegere meant quite the same as `to know', and:
Ratii, for them, meant the composition of arithmetical elements and, as such, the faculty that is proper to man and puts him ahead of the animals. (Vico, 1710, Ch.l,
Reason, he said, produces knowledge by finding out how things are put together or made. It specifies what they consist of and how the components are related among each other. For God, who created the world, making and knowing are one and the same, and His knowledge is infinite.
This is the norm to which all human truths should be compared; this is to say, among human cognitions those are true, whose elements are within ourselves and co-ordinated by ourselves and which, by means of postulates we continue to produce ad infinitum; and as we put together these elements, we become the makers of the truths that we know by composing them." (Vico, 1710, Ch.l, par.III,2)
Human reason, therefore, can know only those things that are made of material to which it has access which is the material of experience and it is through the making that the knowledge of them arises. As far as I know, Vico was the first to state unequivocally that our rational knowledge is constructed by ourselves. But he was also a religious man and had a stake in metaphysics. Hence he wanted to account for mystical knowledge. He did this in a way that is both simple and effective, by dividing knowledge in two kinds: 'rational knowledge', which regards the world of everyday experience and science; and 'poetic wisdom', which regards all that lies beyond that tangible world.
The rational can be expressed in 'vulgar language', by which he meant words that designate experiential things and the relations abstracted from them. The poetic, in contrast, is expressed in metaphors that point beyond the rationally accessible. He explicitly says:
. . . to give utterance to our understanding of spiritual things . . we must seek aid from our imagination to explain them and, like painters, form human images of them. (Vico, 1744, par.402)
Vico went to great lengths to show that, at the beginnings of human culture, all abstract knowledge was couched in poetic metaphors, the language of fables.'
One of his examples is the one that Joyce picked when he wrote Finnegans Wake. Thunder, Vico remarked, was both terrifying and inexplicable. It came
37
54

Radical Constructivism
from the sky, and its origin could not be investigated. For the primeval mind, therefore, a superhuman power, a god, had to reside in the sky (ibid. par.377). So the sky became the abode of superhuman powers and the origin of things and events that could not be accounted for by explanations gathered by induction from everyday experience.
Vico calls such imaginative inventions 'metaphorical' because they are based on analogies of which only one half is accessible. Even the earliest human beings could hear a thunder-like noise when they pushed a boulder out of their cave and it rolled down the mountainside; and they imagined that thunder must be caused in a similar way (ibid. par.444). The similarity, however, is merely an assumption projected beyond the realm of experience where it could be checked. It is not an hypothesis but a fable. When such fables are repeated from generation to generation and coordinated with one another, a mythology is created, its origin in poetic imagination is forgotten, and it is taken as knowledge that was abstracted by someone from actual experience.
Vico had many other seminal thoughts. He suggested, for instance, that geometry was constructed on the basic mental operation that generates a point, and that this was the same operation that generated a moment in time. He anticipated the Piagetian notions that development could always be described in stages and that the human mind assimilates the unknown to the concepts with which it is familiar. In my view, however, his most powerful contribution to the analysis of ideas was the clear distinction he provided between metaphors based on an analogy in experience and the poetic ones of the mystic (or metaphysician) who projects things and events by means of analogy into the unknowable."
Kant's 'Transcendental Enterprise'
So far, I have used the term 'metaphysics' to refer to attempts to describe the world as a whole, including both the domain of human experience and whatever is supposed to lie beyond. In Kant's work, the term becomes more complex because he uses it in explicitly differentiated senses which he characterizes by means of two expressions that are easily confused: transcendental and transcendent. He calls his analytical/critical investigations of reason 'transcendental philosophy' and specifies that this deals with:
understanding and reason itself as a system of concepts and principles that regard objects in general, without the assumption of things that might be given [ontology]. The second (the transcendent) regards Nature, i.e., the sum of given objects whether they be given to the senses or, if you will, to some other kind of intuition. (Kant, 1787; p.873; my emphasis)
He repeats several times that all that belongs to this second, 'transcendent' part is 'speculative' and 'goes beyond the bounds of possible experience'. In
38

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas A History in Quotations
my view, the second part is rationally unconvincing because it has to employ concepts and language that were derived from experience, and the use of such means 'beyond the bounds of experience' therefore implicitly involves the assumption that the range of their application stretches beyond the domain in which they were formed. I agree with Vico and claim that whatever is transcendent can be spoken of only in poetic metaphors and therefore belongs to the realm of the mystical.
Kant's 'transcendental philosophy', however, is a purely rational analysis of human understanding and provides a model that is in many ways fundamental to the constructivist orientation.
In the preface to his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant observed that, as far as he could see, all prior attempts to investigate the products of our knowing, i.e.,
our cognitions, did not progress with 'the sure tread of a science' (1787, p.vii)." One reason for this is that:
Until now one assumed that all cognition had to conform to objects . . . Henceforth one might try to find out whether we d .1 not get further . . . if we assume that the objects have to conform to our cognition. (Kant, 1787, p.xvi)
Of Galilei, Torricelli, and other scientists he says that they 'saw the light':
They understood that reason can comprehend only what she herself has brought forth according to her design . . .
. . . On the one hand, reason must proceed according to her principles, and only in accordance with them may appearances count as laws; and on the other hand, reason must approach Nature, not like a student who listens to whatever the teacher wants to say, but rather like an appointed judge who compels the witnesses to reply to the questions he puts to them. (Kant, 1787. p.xiii)
The first three lines of this quotation could be a summary of what Eriugena wrote a thousand years earlier. Then, it was intended to show that reason could not encroach on the mystic's wisdom. For Kant, it was the premise that led to his analysis of all rational knowing, summarized in his The conflict of the faculties (1798).
The understanding is a wholly active power of the human being; all
its ideas and concepts are but its creation, .. . External things are only
occasions that cause the working of the understanding . . . the product of its action are ideas and concepts. Thus, the things to which these presentations ( Vorstelliingen)15 and concepts refer cannot be what our mind presents to itself; because the mind can create only presentations
.39

Radical ConstructivIsm
of its own objects and not of real things, that is, through these presentations and concepts, things cannot possibly be known as they might be in-themselves. (Kant, 1798, Werke, Vol.vii, p.71)
This leaves open the question why things should be considered 'external' at all, and not simply figments of human imagination. Kant's answer is extremely complicated and therefore open to a variety of readings that I consider to be misinterpretations.
The things our senses and our understanding present to us . .. are the product of the coming together of causal occasions and the effect of understanding. Nevertheless they are not [merely] appearance, for in our practical life we can consider them real things and objects of our presentations because we must suppose that it is real things that provide those causal occasions. (ibid.)
The 'must suppose' is a crucial point. Realists may be tempted to read it as indicating that Kant's theory requires the existence of 'real things' in the sense of actual 'things-in-themselves'. I think, this would be the wrong reading. Rather, Kant speaks here of a need that arises in 'practical life', especially when we want to coordinate our actions with those of others. The thing-initself, Kant reiterates in many places (e.g., 1787; p.591, 610), is intended as a `product of thought' (Gedankending) that serves as a 'heuristic fiction' (1787, p.799). To my mind, this covers any conception of an ontic reality that is structured in space and time. The fiction of such a reality, however, becomes necessary for the purpose of social interaction.
In a later essay on The ability to know' (von' Erkenntnisvermagen, the first section of his Anthropology, 1800) where he explains his approach to the senses, he returns to the notion of 'appearance':
Perceptions of the senses (empirical presentations with consciousness) can only be called internal appearances. It is not until the understanding that joins them and connects them by a rule of thought (which brings order into the manifold), that they become empirical knowledge, i.e., experience. (Kant,1800, Werke, Vol.vii, p.144)
Kant's term 'the manifold' (das Mannigfaltige) indicates another key concept. It is comprehensible only in conjunction with the basic presupposition of his theory, that space and time are the fundamental forms which human reason imposes on all experience. These forms are a priori because they are inherent in the functioning of reason. The 'manifold', then, is the raw material, the stuff on which constructive perception and reason can operate. William James called it, 'one big blooming buzzing confusion' (James, 1962, p.29). In present-day neurophysiology one would say, it is the totality of electrochemical impulses continuously generated by the sensory organs of the system. Even
40

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas. A History in Quotations
if one assumes that these impulses are caused by differences of an ontic substrate they cannot convey qualitative information, because qualitatively they are all the same.
Experience, thus, is what the thinking subject coordinates (constructs) out of elements of the manifold and the fact that only certain things are constructed, and others not, is determined by the structure of reason, which Kant considers the primary topic of his transcendental philosophy. This philosophy is rightly called 'rational idealism'. It proposes a painstaking and ingenious model that reason constructs of itself and it reduces the view of the universe entirely to ideas. For whatever lies outside the domain of reason, Kant uses the term nournenon, and he affirms that, though the assumption of noumena is rationally necessary, they remain unknowable. Thus he returns to the position of the 'negative' theologians and pits his agnostic model against all the great philosophers who preceded him.
From the beginning of western philosophy, the knowledge human reason constructs was in some way thought to be related to an independent reality. For most of the thinkers the relation had to be some form of representation; an imperfect, nebulous representation perhaps, but still a picture that correctly rendered some aspects of reality. Berkeley and Vico realized that reason could not have the required access, so they circumvented the problem, each in his own way, by making the connection through God, the creator of both the real world and mankind. All idealist and rationalist philosophers, from Plato to Leibniz, drew in some way on the notion of God to prevent their systems from slipping into solipsism, i.e., the idea that, the world has no existence outside the thinker's subjective mind.
Kant then systematically dismantled all previous attempts rationally to prove the existence of God. But he concluded that it is equally impossible rationally to prove the non-existence of God, and that the undeniable possibility of His existence should be sufficient for the believer (1787, pp.770, 781). As he did in the case of the thing-in-itself, he claimed that to assume an all-powerful creator of the world, is rationally necessary, but that this does not add to our knowledge, because it means no more than 'to assume a something of which we have no conception what it might be in-itself' (pp.725-6).
A Re-assessment of Causality
Throughout the nineteenth century science expanded in every conceivable direction and provided a vast seedbed for technology. The development of mechanical gadgets and machines flourished as never before. On the one hand, they profoundly modified the experiential world of human beings in the West and beyond; on the other, their practical success helped to reinforce the illusion that the theories from which they sprang were coming closer and closer to representing the world as it really is. Before the turn of the century, there were not only popular writers but also scientists who proclaimed that the
41

Radical ConstructIvism
important problems had been solved, and all that remained was the need to mop up a few details here and there (see Bernal, 1971; p.665). The once mysterious ways the world works had all been reduced to causal relations.
But there were other scientists and some of the greatest among them who did riot share such facile optimism. Hermann von Helmholtz, for instance, who had been an attentive reader of both Hume and Kant, wrote:
Not until later in my life] did I make clear to myself that the principle of causality is, in fact, nothing else but the presupposition of the lawlikeness of all appearances of nature. (Helmholtz, 1881/1977)1'
Causality, then, is part of the design that reason imposes on experience to make it understandable. But where does so particular a design come from? Hume suggested that it arose from the repeated contiguity of perceptions in the flow of experience. This idea was soon discredited by a simple observation: in our experience, day is contiguous with night, and night with day, yet it makes no sense to consider either the cause of the other. For Kant, the relation of cause and effect was a 'synthetic a priori' category, inherent from the outset in our thinking. He did not mean that it was innate or God-given in the sense of a Platonic idea, but rather that it was one of those heuristic fictions that reason needed in order to generate a rational picture of itself as the producer of understanding.
Such circularity is an inevitable characteristic not only of Kant's transcendental philosophy but of any attempt to construct a rational model of how we generate a coherent picture of the world from within our experience. It is the means that bridges gaps which the mystic fills with a poetic metaphor. The constructivist is well aware that circularity cannot be avoided but he would like to reduce it to a minimum. In the case of causality, a plausible conceptual analysis was not supplied until much later, in Piaget's Genetic Epistemology (see Chapter 3).
New Fuel for Instrumentalism
For all instrumentalist approaches to knowledge, the most important event of the nineteenth century was the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution. William James was perhaps the first to make the relevant connection. In a brilliant essay, in which he pits Darwin's precise notion of selection against Spencer's hollow sociological assumptions, he says of the origin of new conceptions that they:
. . . are originally produced in the shape of random images, fancies, accidental out-births of spontaneous variation in the fun onal activity of the excessively instable human brain, which the outer environment simply confirms or refutes, adopts or rejects, preserves or
:69

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas: A History in Quotations
destroys selects, in short, just as it selects morphological and social variations due to molecular accidents of an analogous sort. ( James, 1880, p.456)
On the following page he applies the idea to the scientific investigator, and it becomes clear that by the loose expression 'the outer environment' he was not referring to an independent, objective world:
To be fertile in hypotheses is the first requisite, and to be willing to throw them away the moment experience contradicts them, is the next. (ibid. p.457)
He is speaking of 'experience', not of a world as it might be in itself.' That this is so, can be gathered from many other statements he made in the context of his theory of pragmatism (e.g. James, 1907; p.49).
The notion that Hypotheses are maintained only if they find some confirmation in experience, was certainly not new. But that this was analogous to living organisms surviving in an environment, was revolutionary. Until then, hypotheses were thought to become theories and, through further confirmation, factual accounts or laws that were believed to represent an objective reality. Now the progress of science and human knowledge in general could be seen as a continuous evolution which, as an analogy, was in complete harmony with Darwin's biological theory.
This view was quickly spread and, as so often when philosophical ideas are simplified for distribution, it was encapsulated in a slogan. Pragmatism became known as the movement that proclaimed. `Truth is what works'. Because one could say that what survives and is able to reproduce, works in biological evolution, it was assumed that also in the domain of concepts and ideas, the criterion was a simple and utilitarian one. James himself occasionally contributed to this interpretation, e.g., when he wrote of the `pragmatistic view':
. . . all our theories are instrumental, are mental modes of adaptation to reality, rather than revelations or gnostic answers to some divinely instituted world-enigma. ( James, 1907/1955, p.127)
However, 'confirmation in experience' is a far more complex matter when it involves conceptual structures rather than biological responses or attributes. The 'mode of adaptation' on the conceptual level is not the same as on the physical level of the organism (conceptual equilibration will be discussed in Chapter 3).
The German philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel remarked early on that the evolutionary approach
eliminates the dualism of an independent truth in-itself and . . . experience or selection concerning the practical interaction with the world
43

Radical Construcuotsm
as it comes to be known because the experience of the effects of one's actions at the same time creates truth. (Simmel, 1895, p.44)
In other words, the requirement that knowledge be called true only if it reflects a real world, is relinquished for the requirement that it be found conducive to the attainment of our goals in the world as we experience it. One problem with this view arises once it has become clear that the way we experience the world is dependent on the hypotheses and the knowledge that help us to conceptualize our experiential environment. This is what Heisenberg meant when he said that the further natural scientists look into nature, the more they realize that what they are seeing is a reflection of their own concepts (see Chapter 1).
In spite of this problem, the movement of evolutionary epistemology that developed around the work of Konrad Lorenz, has gained considerable momentum, especially in the extended form given it by Donald Campbell, who characterizes it as `hypothetical critical realism'. He agrees with Lorenz, that the concepts of space, time, and causality are not, as Kant thought, a priori elements of human reason, but rather the result of living organisms' adaptation to the universe. But he claims that modern physics `provides a much finer grained view of reality'.
The Ding an rich is always known indirectly, always in the language of the knower's posits, be these mutations governing bodily form, or visual percepts, or scientific theories. In this sense it is unknowable. But there is an objectivity in the reflection, however indirect, an objectivity in the selection from innumerable less adequate posits. (Campbell, 1974, p.447)
The flaw in assuming such a 'reflection' of objective reality is that there is no reason to believe that any evolved structure, be it physical, behavioural, or conceptual, that proves viable (i.e., adapted) at the moment, is necessarily on the way to the best possible adaptation. The natural selection that preserved what lives today could choose only among the variations that accidental changes had actually produced. On the conceptual level, then, the 'innumerable less adequate posits' that Campbell mentions, leave out the far more innumerable ones that were never tried because they were incompatible with some basic principle that seemed indispensable at the time. Besides, the notion that the adaptedness of organisms provides a glimpse of the structure of Nature as it is, hardly jibes with the biologist's finding that the vast majority of species that were evolved and survived for millions of years, were nevertheless extinguished at some point.
However, there is a more basic logical flaw in the premises of evolutionary epistemology. Lorenz wrote: 'Adaptation to a given condition of the environment is equivalent to the acquisition of information about that given condition' (1979, p.167). This is the primary assumption of his school of
44

thought, and it is unwarranted. The biological notion of fitness or viability does,not require that organisms or species have information about or share properties with an independently 'given' environment. Adaptation merely re4;uires that they avoid points of friction or collision. Whatever has passed through the sieve of natural selection might know that it has passed, but this does not provide any indication of the structure of the sieve. Both in the theory of evolution and in constructivism, `to fit' means no more than to have passed through whatever constraints there may have been.

Hypotheses and Fictions

From 1876 to the first decade of our century, Hans Vaihinger, the founder of the German Kant Society, worked on a monumental work he called `The philosophy of as if' (Die Philosophie des Als Ob, 1913)1'. In it, starting from Kant's critical work, he develops his theory of 'fictions' that pertains to the entire field of human intellectual production and proposes a new way of looking at philosophy. He mentions Bentham as a forerunner and then proceeds to develop from the 'as if' principle a vast analytical enterprise that covers all areas but focuses in particular on philosophy and science. Rather than base his investigation, as Bentham did, on the common use of language, he follows Kant and analyses the possibilities of conceptualization. This leads him to accentuate the extremely important distinction between 'heuristic fictions' (a term that stems from Kant) and 'hypotheses'.
The way he distinguishes the two concepts sounds quite simple but is bound to be misunderstood if the reader does not take into account its derivation from Kant's theory of rational knowledge.

An hypothesis, as we have seen, must be verifiable. It will be definitely included in the stock of scientific ideas when it has been found to be true, i.e., verified . . . A fiction cannot be confirmed by experience, but it can be justified by the service it renders to science . . . Once justified, the fiction will be admitted as a useful member to the domain of ideas. When it helps a thought computation to yield a practically
useful result, as for instance, when the method of infinitesimals makes a curve computable, when an artificial or fictitious partitioning yields a practical order, then such auxiliary ideas are justified. . . Just as the hypothe.,s is submitted to a test of the experiential reality of what was hypothesised. so the fiction is tested as to the practical usefulness and appropriateness of what it invented. (Vaihinger, 1913, pp.610
11)

The 'verification' referred to at the beginning of the quoted passage is not intended ontologically, but, as the author makes clear in what follows, he intends confirmation by experience. Though Vaihinger created a considerable

62

45

Radical Constructivism
stir among European thinkers, he was all but ignored by English-speaking philosophers. His notion of useful fictions, however, has recently cropped up under another name. Gregory Bateson, in his well-known and often quoted 'Metalogue: What is an instinct?' (1972a), speaks of an 'explanatory principle' which, like gravity, can explain 'anything you want it to explain'. Bateson's way of distinguishing explanatory principles from hypotheses is not as explicit as Vaihinger's, but it links the idea of useful fiction to that of the cybernetician who constructs a conceptual or mechanical model to substitute for something that is inaccessible. He explains it to his daughter as follows:
F: . . . You see, an hypothesis tries to explain some particular something but an explanatory principle like 'gravity' or 'instinct' really explains nothing. It's a sort of conventional agreement between scientists to stop trying to explain things at a certain point. D: Then is that what Newton meant? If 'gravity' explains nothing but is only a sort of full stop at the end of a line of explanation, then inventing gravity was not the same as inventing an hypothesis, and he could say he not lingo any hypotheses. F: That's right. There's no explanation of an explanatory principle. It's like a black box. (Bateson, 1972a, p.39)
As Vaihinger illustrated in many ways, we could not even begin to construct a picture of the world, without employing fictitious entities and relations. However, what he showed to be crucial for the proper understanding of human understanding, is that these fictions be recognized as tools for the rational organization of experience and not mistaken for phenomena that are real in the sense that they themselves could be experienced.
The Foundation of Language Analysis
During the forty years straddling the turn of the century, there emerged quite a few people who broke away from supposedly established ideas and opened new perspectives. The upheaval is no doubt most obvious in the visual arts, but it became apparent also in literature, music, and philosophy. I am not competent to judge to what extent the surge was due to the revolution in physics, but from a constructivist point of view, authors such as Poincare, Duhem, Mach, and the mathematician Brouwer, contributed to preparing the way. Some of their ideas will crop up in later chapters.
One thinker, however, is of particular importance for the constructivist approach bocause he gave the study of language a new foundation from which it could embark on a scientific track that was different from traditional philology. Ferdinand de Saussure has become known as the father of modern linguistics, although lie himself never published a book. This is not the only oddity about his work. If one comes to Saussure because of the frequent
46

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas: A History in Quotations
references to him in the works of other authors, one cannot help being struck by the fact that few modern linguists have actually taken up what is, in a philosophical sense, the most important principle he laid down, namely that the meaning of words is to be found in the minds of speakers, rather than in the domain of so-called real objects.
We owe a compendium of Saussure's theory to two of his students who compiled an extremely interesting and readable book from their own and other students' notes, and, most importantly, their teacher's lecture notes (de Saussure, 1916/1959).
The feature of Saussure's investigation that distinguishes it from philology and much of later linguistics, is that he does not begin by analysing a vocabulary or grammatical rules, but rather by examining how language functions. When two people speak to each other, he notes, both utter sounds and both hear the sounds the other utters. He shows this in a diagram with two speakers linked by two arrows forming a circuit.
Suppose that two people, A and B, are conversing with each other. Suppose that the opening of the circuit is in A's brain, where mental facts (concepts) are associated with representations of the linguistic sounds (sound-images) that are used for expression. A given concept unlocks a corresponding sound-image in the brain; this purely psychological phenomenon is followed in turn by a physiological process: the brain transmits an impulse corresponding to the image to the organs used in producing sounds. Then the sound waves travel from the mouth of A to the ear of B: a purely physical process. Next, the circuit continues in B, but the order is reversed: from the ear to the brain, the physiological transmission of the sound-image; in the brain, the psychological association of the image with the concept. If B then speaks, the new act will follow from his brain to A's exactly the same course as the first act and pass thi ough the same successive phases, .. . (de Saussure, 1959, p.11-12)
This explanation is both simple and fundamental. It provides a model of the mechanics of communication that illustrates two things.
1 The two-way correspondence between sound-images. and concepts, which is in fact the semantic connection between a word and its meaning, is the result of psychological association. Psychological associations, however, can be formed only by an individual in his or her subjective experience (see Chapter 7).
2 Since no individual's experience can cover all the situations that have given rise to the associations (i.e., the semantic connections) that have been formed by the social group as a whole, the collective sense of the word 'language' (Saussure's langue) requires an abstraction that even
47

Radical Construchvism
a diligent observer of a great many linguistic interactions can only hope to approximate.
If one accepts this analysis, the notion collapses that every child growing up in a linguistic community will automatically associate the sound-images it perceives with concepts that are shared with the entire community. Instead, learning the language will be seen as a never ending process of adaptation of one's own concepts, governed by the need and the wish to establish mutually compatible associations to the speech sounds one is hearing and producing.
The expression 'shared meaning' is therefore a little misleading. Awareness of the ambiguity of the word 'to share' may help to clarify this. It is one thing, to share a car, but quite a different thing, to share a bottle of wine. In the first case, two or more individuals are using one and the same car; in the second, none of the wine drunk by one person can be drunk by another. Sharing a meaning is a little like the second example, but not at all like the first. We cannot share our experience with others, we can only tell them about it, but in doing so, we use the words that we have associated with it. What others understand when we speak or write is necessarily in terms of the meanings their experience has led them to associate with the sound images of the particular words and their experience is never identical with ours.
Given that language users as a rule achieve a great deal of linguistic cornpazibility with the others of their group, they easily come to believe that the words they use actually refer to objects in a real world and that, therefore, language does provide a description of things beyond individual experience. The implicit reasoning that leads to this illusion is something like: if so many refer to the same things, the things must be real. But this overlooks the way in which each language user constructs meanings, and that these meanings had to be adapted to the others' use of words and thus modified the practice of segmenting and talking about experience.
In discussing the relation between language and reality, Richard Rorty speaks of the temptation to 'think that there is some relation called "fitting the world" or "expressing the real nature of the self" (Rorty, 1989, p.6). I hope to have shown that succumbing to that temptation would lead to an altogether untenable position, even if one interprets the 'fitting' in the constructivist way as 'being compatible', rather than 'matching', which would be the realist's interpretation. The only fit we can assess is a fit with the world as we experience it.
Conclusion
It has no doubt become clear that this trot through the history of ideas is the subjective presentation of pieces an eclectic reader has collected in his attempt to construct a relatively coherent, non-contradictory model of knowing. It does not claim to present the truth about what the authors of the quoted
48

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas A History in Quotations
passages intended, but only a viable reading. I do not believe that any amount of hermeneutical research can produce a true replication of the concepts historical thinkers had in mind. I have therefore chosen to interpret their texts as best I can from my point of view. I hold with the French poet (and mathematician) Paul Valery, who said:
I have already explained what I think of literal interpretation; but one cannot insist enough on this: there is no true meaning of a text. No author's authority. Whatever he may have wanted to say, he wrote what he wrote. Once published, a text is like an implement that everyone can use as he chooses and according to his means: it is not certain that the maker could use it better than someone else. (Valery, 1957, p.1507)
I set out to substantiate the claim that reason could not deal with the mystical and its wisdom. The pre-Socratics already argued that a reality independent of the human ways of knowing was not accessible to us, because we cannot step out of our ways of knowing. This was a purely logical limitation. Early Christian theologians added another argument: because our concepts are formed by abstraction from experience, they cannot capture anything that lies beyond our experience. The medieval mystic, John Scottus Eriugena, then anticipated both Vico and Kant in saying that reason can know and understand only what it itself has made according to its own rules.
The birth of modern science in the Renaissance brought forth the suggestion that scientific knowledge was instrumental and should therefore be kept apart from the mystical, which was timeless. But the rediscovery of Pyrrhon's early school of scepticism encouraged some to use the sceptics' arguments against certain knowledge to question the dogma of the Church. Descartes intended to stop this by demonstrating that there were, indeed, things that could be known with certainty. His method of radical doubt, in the end, only confirmed the sceptics' position.
Each of the three famous empiricists provided basic insights into the process of knowledge construction. Locke spoke of reflection upon mental operations as a source of ideas; Berkeley noted that time, succession, number, and other indispensable concepts, are mental constructs; Hume, explained the active generation of relational concepts by acts of association.
Berkeley's contemporary, Vico, produced the first explicit formulation of a constructivist approach -- human reason can know only what humans themselves have made; and, more importantly perhaps, he suggested a way to distinguish the language of the mystic by its irreducible metaphors from the language of reason which is anchored in experience.
Kant's analysis of the rational domain then confirmed the inaccessibility of anything posited beyond the reach of experience and maintained that the world we understand and live in bec)mes real to us, because we complete the picture by means of rational heuristic fictions.
Following this lead in Kant's work, Vaihinger produced his 'Philosophy
49
66

Radical Constructivism
of as if', an analysis of western intellectual culture and science in terms of useful fictions. Although he occasionally refers to the problem of children's construction of concepts, his approach is on the whole a philosopher's who considers knowledge to be more or less static. The fact that he says little about how fictions are built up, is the main reason why he cannot properly be called a constructivist.
The concepts of variation and (natural) selection, taken from Darwin's theory of evolution, opened the possibility of substituting the notion of adaptedness for the philosophers' traditional notion of truth as a correct, or a least approximately correct, representation of objective reality. However, the question of what the constraints relative to which adaptation occurs are, is answered differently by contemporary schools. Evolutionary epistemologists, for example, tend to reduce all knowledge including the elementary concepts of space and time to biological adaptation in the service of survival. For them, the theory of evolution is an unquestionable ontological given and thus the basis for the illusion that the products of adaptation provide positive information about the constraining world. I call it an illusion because none of the `critical realisms' that have been based on the evolutionary principle is able to show how a cognizing subject might turn its notion of adaptedness into
knowledge of reality. Finally, de Saussure characterized language as
a system of signs in which the only essential thing is the union of meanings and sound-images, and in which both parts of the sign are psychological. (de Saussure, 1959, p.15)
Since this union has to be created by every language user on the basis of his or her individual experience, the meanings we attribute to words cannot be anything but subjective. This eliminates the traditional philosophical 'Theory of Reference', which is based on the notion that words refer to things-inthemselves. Instead, words can now be thought to refer to whatever abstraction from experience, i.e., whatever meaning, the individual language user happens to have made.
The notion of communication arises from the assumption that organisms who live in groups and have the capability of abstracting images and ideas from their experiences, will make many such abstractions in situations where they arc in the company of others which leads them to the assumption that the others have made the same abstractions as they themselves. Once they associate sound-images of words with their ideas, they will come to believe that the meanings of words are the same whenever their interactions with others show them to be compatible. Since such compatibility is crucial in many forms of necessary collaboration, the members of a community will do their best to make their meanings compatible with those of others.
Our meanings, then, may be modified and adapted to common usage in the constant non-linguistic and linguistic interactions we have with others;
50

Unpopular Philosophical Ideas: A History in Quotations
but the result of such adaptation will at best achieve a relative compatibility, never identity.
From all this, with the help of Piaget's theory of cognitive development (see Chapter 3), radical constructivism formulated its fundamental principles:
1 Knowledge is not passively received either through the senses or by way of communication; knowledge is actively built up by the cognizing subject.
2 The function of cognition is adaptive, in the biological sense of the term, tending towards fit or viability; cognition serves the subject's organization of the experiential world, not the discovery of an objective ontological reality.
The last of the four points seems the most difficult to accept. Even Kant, who had so many brilliant ideas about the ways and means of conceptual construction, was not inclined to give up the search for ontological truth. Some serious critics of radical constructivism are driven by the same attachment.' They refuse to consider that this theory of knowing is intended
as a tool that should be tested for its usefulness rather than taken as a
metaphysical proposal.

1 Since I have no Greek, the translations I give of the pre-Socratics are based on the German translations of Hermann Diels (1957) and the English ones by W.K.C. Guthrie (1962, 1971).
2 The idea was also picked up by the eighteenth-century philosopher Berkeley (1732/1950, p.166).
3 Translation by Sheldon-Williams, quoted in R. Kearney (1985). 4 Note that throughout this text the word 'model' is used, as in cybernetics, to refer
to a physical or conceptual structure invented to simulate the behaviour of a 'black box', i.e., something that behaves in unexpected or interesting ways, but whose insides are not accessible to observation. 5 The argument whether Galilei continued to believe, like Plato, in the transcendence of mathematical laws or, late in his life, came closer to the view suggested by Bellarrnino, is still going on (see Belloni, 1975). 6 Since the edition of Berkeley's collected works by Luce and Jessop (1950), the notebook is called 'Philosophical Commentaries'; earlier it was known as the 'Commonplace Book'. 7 I mentioned in Chapter 1 that Bishop Berkeley also developed a metaphysics in which the real world was held together by God. Though Locke and Hume had no official link to the Church, they had no sympathy for atheism and devoted much time and space to reconciling their sceptical view of rational knowledge with the accepted faith in the revelation of God's reality. Constructivism, as I stated at the beginning, suggests an approach to rational thought and therefore neither engages in nor denies metaphysical considerations.

8 Bentham used the term 'entity' for what today we might call an 'item', t e , anything whatever.
9 Note that in present-day English, 'it's true that . ..' and It's a fact that .. .' are
also used interchangeably. 10 I refer to the 1850 edition of Vico's treatise, which contains the Latin text as well
as Pomodoro's translation, giving the original numbers of chapters, paragraphs, and propositions. 11 Those who have read Piaget will be startled by this remarkable anticipation of Piagetian ideas. 12 'Every metaphor', he says, 'is a fable in brief' (1744, par.404). 13 In spite of the clarity of this distinction, Vico himself did not waver in his religious faith and devoted a great deal of time and words to metaphysics. In a manner parallel, but not identical with that of Berkeley, he attempted to give eternal validity to man's rational constructs. 14 Kant uses the word Erkenntnis, which contains the German root of cognizing rather than that of knowing; hence I translate it as 'cognition'. 15 The word Vorstellung is a key term in Kant's philosophy. When it is translated as `representation', this is bound to inisle2.-!, because this English word suggests that there is an original that is being represented. The end of the quoted sentence makes clear that Kant uses the word as it is normally used in German, namely indicating something one presents to oneself spontaneously and not as the copy of something else. 16 This was written in 1881 as an addition to Helmholtz' 1847 treatise on `The conservation of force'. It can be found on p.180 of his Epistemological writings, 1977. Historically, it is of interest that the passage was quoted in one of the last lectures of the course on The physical foundations of the natural sciences' by Franz Exner (1919), whom Erwin Schrodinger later cited as one of his most influential teachers. 17 On the relation between experience and reality, James has made a statement that is as profound as it is subtle: `Everything real must be experienceablesomewhere, and every kind of thing experienced must somewhere be real' (1912, p.159; my emphasis). 1 have italicized 'kind' because it would be easy to overlook the distinction James is making: Like Berkeley, he calls only those things 'real' that can be experienced somewhere; and kinds of things, i.e., the concepts we have abstracted, must be Wsed on things that are 'real' in the sense he has defined otherwise they are hollow or, as Vico would say, 'poetic metaphors'. 18 An excellent, slightly abridged translation by C.K. Ogden, reprinted by Barnes and Noble (New York, 1968) makes the sixth edition of this work accessible to English readers. 19 Recently it has been suggested that radical constructivism is contradictory because it attacks realism and at the same time assumes a realist position by admitting that an ontological reality may constrain human action (e.g., Matthews, 1992, p.186). In the usual language of philosophers, 'realists' are those who believe that they can obtain knowledge of a world as it is in itself. This I deny, and admitting 'ontic' constraints does not contradict it, because while they may determine what is impossible, they do not determine the ways of acting and thinking that can be constructed within them.

Chapter 3
Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing

It is a difficult task to glean a coherent theory of cognitive development from Piaget's enormous body of work. Over a period of seventy years, Piaget published eighty-eight books, hundreds of articles, and edited countless reports of research that had been carried out under his supervision.' His thinking and his ideas never ceased to develop, to branch out, and to spiral into new formulations which, in his mind, continuously expanded and modified what he had expressed in earlier writings. As a result, it requires considerable effort to sort out what seems to have remained the same and what was modified in the course of those decades. Thoqc who venture to summarize Piaget's ideas on the basis of two or three of his books have a limited perspective. They inevitably remain unaware of implications that cannot be grasped
except from other parts of his work. Unfortunately, there are countless psychology textbooks and critical journal articles that fail in this respect. At best they provide an incomplete view of Piaget's theory, at worst they perpetuate distortions of his key concepts. Many summarizers and critics, moreover, seem to have missed, or simply disregarded, the revolutionary approach to epistemology that Piaget developed as the basis of his investigations. This second failing is the more serious. Without the understanding that Piaget quite deliberately stepped out of the western philosophical tradition, it is impossible to come to a comprehensive view of his theory of knowing and
the model he built to explain how children acquire knowledge. Piaget is not easy reading. Although he never ceased to praise the virtue
of `decentration' the ability to shift one's perspective , he himself, as a writer, did not always try to put himself into his reader's shoes. I feel that writing often was for him, as for many original thinkers, part of working out his ideas for himself. His untiring efforts to express his thoughts in the greatest possible detail do not always help the reader's understanding. Yet, I never doubted that it was worth trying to overcome those difficulties, for the effort has led me to a view of human knowing that no other source could have
provided. For six or seven years I concentrated almost exclusively on Piaget; and I
have sporadically returned to his writings for almost two decades since then. Yet I want to emphasize that what I lay out here is the sense that one rather

53

diligent reader has extracted. It is certainly not the only possible interpretation, let alone an official one. But it is an interpretation that I have found cogent and extremely useful in a variety of applications. This , however, does not make it any less subjective.
'There are at least half a dozen concepts that have to be characterized with a certain precision if we want to arrive at a coherent interpretation of Piaget's theory. The task of characterizing someone else's concepts is necessarily a conjectural one. One cannot enter another's head to examine what conceptual structures he or she has associated with certain words. As readers of Piaget's writings, therefore, we can only conjecture what a given word meant to him when he used it. As we come across the word again and again in his works, we can try to modify or reconstruct our supposition in the hope of arriving at an interpretation that fits, if not all, at least a large number of occurrences. In principle, this is the process of hermeneutics, the art of unravelling the original meaning of texts. It silould be clear that there can be no absolute answers. The reader's attempt to construct for each word a constant meaning that might fit all the encountered contexts can yield only relative results. On the one hand, the notion of fit is inevitably a relative one and, on the other, it is based on the assumption that meanings are constant for a given author. This assumption is obviously an unlikely one in the case of an author who, like Piaget, has used some of his key words for many decades during which his thinking continued to expand. Yet, I am convinced that the direction of his search remained unchanged throughout. The interpretations and definitions I am giving here are the ones that make sense to me in the light of those of Piaget's works, and certain passages in them, that I consider central.
The Biological Premise
Piaget was unquestionably the pioneer of the constructivist approach to cognition in this century.' This approach was unconventional when he developed it in the 1930s, and it still goes against the generally accepted view today. It is also an uncomfortable approach, because it requires drastic changes of certain fundamental concepts that have been taken for granted for thousands of years. Among these fundamental concepts are 'Reality', 'Truth', and the very notion of 'what knowledge is' and 'how we come to have it'.
To explain why and how Piaget came to such a drastic break with the western philosophical tradition, we have to look first of all at the starting point of his intellectual career. For the rest, I want to stress that my underlying assumption in this interpretation is that it was Piaget's aim to produce as coherent a model as possible, of human cognition and its development. Although from the outset he had a clear idea of the direction he was going to take, he could not possibly have foreseen all the steps. His model did not grow in a straight line but rather like a tree, sonic of whose branches wither, as the central ideas are developed further. This means that I shall disregard
54

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
statements in his earlier writings that appear to be in flat contradiction with later ones.'
In one of the few autobiographical passages he wrote, Piaget recounts that he decided 'to consecrate my life to the biological explanation of knowledge' (Piaget, 1952b, p.240). It would be difficult to overrate the importance of this statement. To consider cognition as a biological function, rather than the result of impersonal, universal, and ahistorical reason, constitutes a radical break with the philosophers' traditional approach to epistemology. To begin with, it shifts the focus from the ontological world as it might be, to the world that the organism experiences.
As far as I know, Piaget had no contact with the work ofJakob von Uexkiill, but there is a certain similarity in some of the two thinkers' ideas.
What the German biologist called Merkwelt, the world of sensing, and Wirkwelt, the world of acting (von Uexkiill and Kriszat, 1993), is included in Piaget's notion of the `sensorimotor level'. Both authors had been profoundly influenced by Kant's insight that whatever wi! call knowledge is necessarily determined to a large extent, if not altogetl-e by the knower's ways of perceiving and conceiving.
Piaget himself described the goal of his undertaking in his introduction
to The Essential Piaget (Gruber =tad Voneche, 1977):
The search for the nicchanisms of biological adaptation and the analysis of that higher form of adaptation which is scientific thought, the epistemological interpretation of which has always been my central aim. (Piaget, in Gruber and Voneche, 1977, p.xii)
That the acquisition of knowledge was 'adaptive', had been suggested by James, Simmel, and others around the turn of the century, but Piaget saw early on that adaptation in the cognitive/conceptual domain was not the same as the physiological adaptation of biological organisms. On the level of cognition, he realized, it was not a straightforward matter of survival or extinction, but rather of conceptual equilibration. It is important, therefore, to keep in mind that when he speaks of `that higher form of adaptation', the mechanisms he is looking for are mental and not biological as in the ordinary use of that term.
It was this search for the mechanisms of cognition that motivated Piaget's interest in children. By observing the interactions of infants and growing children with their environment, he intended to isolate manifestations of cognitive processes in order to arrive at a generalizable model of cognition and its ontogenesis. From the traditional philosophers' point of view, whatever such an enterprise could yield would be a 'genetic fallacy', because for them, knowledge has to be timeless and immutable and can never be justified by the history of its generation. Consequently, most philosophers felt justified in disregarding whatever Piaget said and wrote. Psychologists and the general public, on the other hand, concluded that he was a child psychologist, because
55
72

Radical Constructivism
his texts frequently referred to developmental phenomena in children. Given this perspective, they did what they could to adjust his ideas so that they could be fitted into the psychological tradition. This often quite unconscious effort was probably the main reason for the colossal misinterpretations that are rampant in the literature.
Active Construction
A typical example is the following. In many places (e.g., 1937, p.10; 1967a, p.10; 1970a, p.15), Piaget explains that, in his view, knowledge arises from the active subject's activity, either physical or mental, and that it is goaldirected activity that gives knowledge its organization.
. . . all knowledge is tied to action, and knowing an object or an event is to use it by assimilating it to an action scheme . (Piaget, 1967a, pp.14-15)
. . . to know an object implies its incorporation in action schemes, and this is true on the most elementary sensorimotor level and all the way up to the highest logical-mathematical operations. (ibid., p.17)
The concept of 'action scheme' is central in Piaget's theory of knowledge, and I shall explain it in detail later on. That it was widely misunderstood, is due above all to the fact that he derived it explicitly from the biological notion of 'reflex'. Action schemes were therefore tacitly interpreted by many readers as stimulusresponse mechanisms. This made traditional psychologists feel comfortable because it allowed them to classify Piaget's theory as an 'interactionist' one a somewhat complicated interactionism, to .be sure, but certainly not a revolutionary doctrine that would shake their fundamental belief in universal objects in a real environment with which living organisms are supposed to interact. This misinterpretation simply confirmed the notion that interaction provides the intelligent organism with knowledge, and that this knowledge, through further interaction, becomes better, in the sense that it comes to reflect the environment more accurately. Thus, although Piaget frequently spoke of 'construction', he could be accepted as a somewhat idiosyncratic developmental theorist, and the psychologists' peace of mind was saved.
Once that view was established, only a direct contradiction might have disrupted it. But explicit contradictions of our age-old common-sense notion of knowledge and the world are difficult to find in Piaget's works. Whenever he says, for instance, that knowledge must not be thought of as a picture or copy of reality (and he says that often enough), it is easy to mistake this for a conventional admonition that a cognitive organism's picture of the world would necessarily be incomplete or somewhat distorted. Any realist will read
56

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
it as such, rather than take it as an integral part of Piaget's view that knowledge, of its nature, cannot have any iconic correspondence with an ontological reality.
Piaget's position can be summarily characterized by the statement: 'The mind organises the world by organising itself' (1937, p.311). The cognitive organism shapes and coordinates its experience and, in doing so, transforms it into a structured world.
What then remains is construction as such, and one sees no ground why it should be unreasonable to think that it is the ultimate nature of reality to be in continual construction instead of consisting of an accumulation of ready-made structures. (Piaget, 1970b, pp.57-8)
Almost none of Piaget's writings could be fully understood without taking into account this revolutionary perspective. Yet it is difficult to remain aware of it, because Piaget only rarely refers to the relation between knowledge and reality or reminds the reader that in his model the 'real' is always the experiential world.
The focus of his work was and remained throughout his long life the design of a viable model of how we manage to construct a relatively stable, orderly picture from the flow of our experience. That he achieved this to a far greater extent than anyone else, is due to several things: his refusal to accept dogmatic explanations, his unfaltering energy in asking new questions, his good fortune in finding an independently brilliant yet cooperative and empirically oriented colleague in Barbel Inhelder, and the passionate explorer's attitude that he characterized in retrospect when he said:
At the end of a career it is better to be ready to change, rather than condemned to repeat oneself. (Piaget, 1976b)4
Beginnings
Piaget embarked on a research career a good deal earlier than most scientists. Around 1907, when he was barely 11-years old, he observed an albino sparrow in a public park near his home in Neuchatel. He wrote a brief note about it, and sent it to a natural history journal. The note was published, and on the strength of it he was allowed to spend his free time after school in helping Monsieur Godet, the director of the local natural-history museum, with the sorting of some collections. Growing up on the shores of lake Neuchatel, he had already become interested in fresh-water molluscs and Paul Godet happened to be an expert in this field. It was a marvellous apprenticeship for the young Piaget.
In 1911, when Paul Godet died, the schoolboy (as Piaget wrote in an autobiographical sketch) knew enough about molluscs:
57

to begin publishing without help (specialists in this branch are rare) a series of articles on the molluscs of Switzerland, of Savoy, of Brittany and even of Columbia. This afforded me some amusing experiences. Certain foreign `colleagues' wanted to meet me, but since I was only a schoolboy, 1 didn't dare to show myself and had to decline these flattering invitations. The director of the Musee d'histoire naturelle of Geneva, who was publishing several of my articles in the Revue Suisse de Zoologie, offered me a position as curator of his mollusc
collection .. . I had to reply that I had two more years to study for
my baccalaureate degree, not yet being a college student.' (Piaget, 1952b, pp.238-9)
In retrospect, one might say that the study of molluscs determined Piaget's intellectual career. In his minute observations of these creatures he noticed
that their shells differed in shap;.: according to their location in still or in running water. It was a clear case of adaptation. But by transplanting some of the molluscs from one environment to the other, he discovered that the shape of their shells seemed not to be due to phylogenetic but rather to ontogenetic adaptation. This difference intrigued him so much apparently, that he
spent the rest of his life studying the living organism's capability of ontogenetic adaptation in its most impressive manifestation on the human level, namely the capability of knowing.
The Construction of Experiential Reality
Since Piaget's theory is, in fact, a theory of the knowing mind, the key terms constitute a closely knit conceptual network and, in one way or another, are all linked and interdependent. To isolate each one in order to explain and define it in separation from the others, is not an ideal way of proceeding but I know of no other possibility. Language is a linear affair and linguistic explanation requires that things be arranged sequentially, one after the other, no matter how intricate their mutual dependencies might be in a given author's mind or in the fabric of our own living experience. This basic problem of presentation is nowhere better illustrated than in Piaget's fundamental work La construction du reel chez !'enfant (1937); which also is a good place to begin an exposition of his theory.
This early book is an attempt to show that human infants can construct for themselves the reality they experience. Indeed, they must do this, whether or not we assume that such a reality exists independently. The book, ofcourse, does not detail the construction of any particular infant's reality with mummy, daddy, teddy bear, and pot, but it shows how the basic concepts that constitute the essential structure of any individual's reality can be built up without the assumption that such a structure exists in its own right. This is a corner stone of Piaget's theory and the most important difference between it and all
58 e

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
traditional theories of knowledge. As a direct consequence of his maxim that 'knowledge is a higher form of adaptation', he relinquished the notion of cognition as the producer of representations of an ontological reality, and replaced it with cognition as an instrument of adaptation the purpose of which is the construction of viable conceptual structures.
The constructive activity during the first two years of life lays the foundation of what will become the child's experiential world: it forms the essential scaffolding for all further constructing. As the child's living experience expands, layer upon layer of conceptual constructs is built upon the foundation. At any subsequent stage of development, therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, introspectively to retrace the path of the early construction or to change the concepts that were its immediate results.
The first eighty-five pages of The Construction of Reality in the Child describe the development of the notion of 'object'. There are two consecutive phases in this development. The first leads to the establishment of object concepts in the sense that the infant coordinates (associates) sensory signals of the 'perceptual' kind that happen to be recurrently available at the same time in its sensory field (the 'locus' of raw material that Kant called 'the manifold').' These concepts could be described as routines for the reconstruction of a particular object of interest, whenever its sensory components are available. Their successful composition may then serve as trigger for a specific activity that has been associated with the object. In that case, an observer might say that the child recognizes the object, although the child may still be unable to conjure up a re-presentation, that is to say, a visualized image of the object, when the relevant sensory material is not actually available (see Chapter 5).
The second developmental phase can occur only when the infant has reached the stage of 'deferred imitation' (Piaget has called this the sixth stage of sensorimotor development, which usually falls within the time frame between the eighteenth and the twenty-fourth month of age). Deferred imitation refers to the child's ability to run through a sequence of physical actions when the perceptual situation that originally led to the coordination of the sequence is not actually present. When the deferred execution does not involve a motor activity but the conceptual coordination of a previously constructed object., it produces a re-presentation.
Unfortunately, Piaget only occasionally spells the word 're-presentation' with a hyphen (e.g. in his La formation du symbole chez l'enfant, 1945). To my mind, the hyphen is essential because Piaget uses the word in a sense that is very different from that intended by contemporary philosophers. For Piaget, re-presentation is always the replay, or re-construction from memory, of a past experience and not a picture of something else, let alone a picture of the real world.
I see a useful analogy to these two phases in the acquisition of vocabulary involved in the learning of a language. No matter what your level of proficiency in a natural language, there will be words that you know when you
59

Radical Constructivism
read or hear them, yet they are not available to you when you speak or write.
You are able to recognize them, but not to re-present them to yourself
spontaneously. To some extent this is the case in anyone's first language, but it is usually more noticeable in a second language, where one's reading knowledge which does not involve the problems of pronunciation is a good deal greater than one's speaking knowledge.
The ability to re-present objects to oneself is linked to language acquisition also in a very direct way. As long as words are usP41 with immediate reference to the situation in which they are uttered, the speaker will be satisfied that the receiver has 'understood' the utterance, if the receiver's reaction is compatible with the speaker's expectation. This sort of 'understanding' is manifested, for instance, by a dog which sits down whenever the master says `sit!'. The dog does not need to have a re-presentation of the meaning of the word 'sit'. Obedience to the command merely requires that the dog has associated the experience of hearing the sound patttern of this particular word with the act of sitting down. In contrast to this, if I said 'last night 1 sat down on a wet bench in the park', you or any other proficient speaker of the English language would not react with a specific motor pattern, but you would produce a mental re-presentation of some experience that, from your point of view, fitted the meaning of that sentence. That is, my utterance would be understood as a sequence of symbols that have to be interpreted conceptually, rather than as a signal associated with a physical reaction. (see Glasersfeld, 1987).
The ability to produce re-presentations of objects is one of the two
essential ingredients of the development of 'object permanence', and this is probably the ontogenetically first context in which re-presentations appear. Later they become the indispensable basis for the most important conceptual activities, such as the presentation of hypothetical situations, hypothetical goals, hypothetical perturbations, and thus for the making of reflective abstractions from experiences that have not actually taken place on the sensorimotor level. I shall return to this in the chapter on reflection and abstraction.
Individual Identity
The second essential ingredient in the construction of permanent objects is the notion of individual identity. Prior to that notion, a comparison between a present experience and the re-presentation of an object will yield a judgment of either difference or sameness. The notion ofindividual identity complicates that issue because it introduces the possibility to construct two kinds of sameness. On the one hand, there is the sameness of two experiential objects that arc considered the same in all respects that have been examined (as in assimilation); this can be called 'equivalence'. On the other hand, there is now the sameness of two experiences that are taken to be two experiences of one individual object.
60

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
The difference between the construction of equivalence as the basis of classification, on the one hand, and the construction of permanence as the basis of individual identity, on the other, springs from assigning perdurance to different items.' In the first case, the set of characteristics which, as a group, differentiate a particular experiential item, from all other constructs, is abstracted and maintained (given perdurance) for future use. It constitutes the template or prototype to which experiences can be assimilated as members of the class. This procedure is the basis of all classification and categorization.
The concept of 'object permanence', on the other hand, is an abstraction from the second type of sameness. It characterizes the situation where a child considers the object it is perceptually constructing at the moment, to be the identical (self-same) individual it experienced at some prior time.' Perdurance is now attributed to the object whether or not it is actually being experienced. Consequently, the item can be said to 'exist'.
The element of individual identity is indispensable for the construction of several other fundamental concepts, such as state and change, process and motion, space, causality, and time (see Chapter 4). To each of the last three of these, Piaget has devoted a chapter in his Construction of Reality in the Child (1937). Only if the reader integrates these chapters with what Piaget presented in the first section of the book, does the fundamental relatedness of these concepts emerge. They are the constructivist substitute for 'categories' that Kant assumed to be a priori.
In order to maintain, for instance, that an object one experiences now is the self-same individual one experienced at some earlier point in the experiential flow, it becomes necessary to think of that object as perduring somewhere outside one's experiential field. This area, where objects might reside during the intervals in which one is not perceiving them, constitutes what I have called `proto-space'. It is a space that has as yet no structure and no metric, and serves merely as a repository for objects that one can re-present to oneself but is not attending to at the moment. It is the space in which the child constructs an external world.
Similarly, once this proto-space has been conceived, the fact that one may have a succession of experiences while other objects are waiting there to be revisited by one's attention, leads to the construction of `proto-time' as the medium of continuity that enables these waiting objects to conserve their individual identity. The continuum of proto-space and proto-time, then, constitutes the domain to which we refer when we use words such as 'existence' or `being' in ordinary language. It should be clear that this domain is an abstraction from our experiential world and in no way entails the absolute ontology traditional philosophers want.
In the last chapter of The Construction of Reality in the Child, Piaget tackles the problem of the subjectobject relation that has bedevilled western philosophy since its beginnings. Here, as in so many other passages of Piaget's writings, it is crucial to remember that he is concerned with genetic epistemology, i.e.,
'th the ontogeny of knowledge, and not with ontology or the metaphysics
61
713'

Radical Constructivism
of being. Thus he assumes a cognizing entity and proposes that this entity gradually distinguishes itself from all it is able to isolate and categorize as 'external' in its active experience. In a later work. he succinctly characterized this development:
. at the termination of this [sensorimotor] period, i.e., when language and thought begin, he [the child] is for all practical purposes but one element or entity among others in a universe that he has gradually constructed himself and which hereafter he will experience as external to himself. (Piaget, 1967b, p.9)
The fact that Piaget continually ties his own construction of his abstract explanatory model of cognitive development to detailed observations and simple but often ingenious experiments with children, has apparently misled a great many readers (especially the more traditional psychologists) into focusing on empirical details rather than on the building blocks of the conceptual edifice he has created. The result has been a vast literature on Piaget's theory of cognitive development that largely disregards his epistemological presuppositions and consequently misinterprets the experiments as tests of performance rather than of conceptual operating.
Assimilation
Both assimilation and accommodation are key terms in Piaget's theory, and they are also among the most misunderstood. Assimilation is often described as the process whereby changing elements in the environment become incorporated into the structure of the organism' (Nash, 1970). This misleads, because it implies that the function of assimilation is to bring material from the environment into the organism. In my interpretation, assimilation must instead be understood as treating new material as an instance of something known. Piaget's own definition, can be found in many of his works. An example is the following:
. . . no behaviour, even if it is new to the individual, constitutes an absolute beginning. It is always grafted onto previous schemes and therefore amounts to assimilating new elements to already constructed structures (innate, as reflexes are, or previously acquired). (Piaget, 1976a, p.17)
Cognitive assimilation conies about when a cognizing organism fits an experience into a conceptual structure it already has. A concrete, mechanical example of assimilation is what happens in those old-fashioned card sorting machines that work with punched cards. If one gives such a machine a deck of cards to compare to a model-card that has, say, three specific holes, it will
62
7a

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
pick out all the cards that have those holes, regardless of any other holes they might have. The machine is not intended to see these other holes and therefore considers all the cards it picks out as equivalent to the model -card. An observer, however, who does see the other holes, could say that the machine is assimilating all the cards to its model-card. The machine does not actively disregard other holes in the cards it examines, it simply does not perceive
them. Piaget borrowed the word `assimilation' from biology. If someone eats
an apple, one might say: His body is assimilating the apple. This does not mean that the apple is somehow modified to fit into the organism's structure, but it means that only certain chemical components of the apple are recognized as useful and extracted by the organism, while all others are ignored and thrown out. In the biological model, therefore, assimilation does take in elements of the environment nutrients or other chemical substances. In the theory of cognition in which Piaget adopted the term, this is not so, because the operative processes are not physical transfer but perception and/or
conception. Once this is understood, the picture we get is quite different from the
traditional one in which the senses are `conveying information or data into the perceiving organism'. Using Piaget's definition, one can say: The cognitive organism perceives (assimilates) only what it can fit into the structures it already has. This, of course, is a description from the observer's point of view. It has actually the important implication that when an organism assimilates, it remains unaware of, or disregards, whatever does not fit into the
conceptual structures it possesses. Because no experiential situation in the life of an organism will be exactly
the same as another, it is clear that in many cases it is advantageous (and therefore adaptive.) to disregard differences. The peculiarity here, again from the observer's point of view, is that the adaptation seems to go in the opposite direction of the usual: perception modifies what is perceived in order to fit it into the organism's conceptual structures, whereas in the general biological sense, natural selection modifies the structure of organisms so that they fit within the constraints inherent in their environment. This apparent reversal of the adaptive process seems odd, as long as one thinks in terms of organisms perceiving objects that exist as such in an independent reality. From the constructivist point of view, however, adaptation does not mean adequation to an external world of existing things-in-themselves, but rather improving the organism's equilibrium, i.e., its fit, relative to experienced constraints. This is a crucial aspect of the constructivist model, and we shall return to it.
In short, assimilation always reduces new experiences to already existing sensorimotor or conceptual structures, and this inevitably raises the question
why and how learning should ever take place. In this regard, too, Piaget has been widely misunderstood because many interpreters seem to have over-
looked the fact that the Geneva school uses the terms assimilation and accom-
modation in the special context of what Piaget called `schemes'.`'
63

Radical Constructivism
From Reflexes to Scheme Theory
Nowhere in Piaget's writings have I found a complete exposition of what I have come to call 'scheme theory'. However, indications that such a theory had, indeed, become a remarkably stable, unifying component of his thinking, can be found in most of his writings after 1935 (e.g., Piaget, 1937, 1945, 1967a). As Barbel Inhelder remarked in her recent book: 'The notion of scheme has given and is still giving rise to different interpretations' (Inhelder and de Caprona, 1992, p.41). 1 certainly do not consider my interpretation the only, let alone the 'right' one, but it is the one we have found most useful, especially in analysing patterns of learning in mathematics and physics education.
Piaget's concept of the scheme also has its roots in biology. He was well acquainted with reflexes and investigated them in his own three children. Given that many reflexes or fixed-action patterns are fully operational in newborn infants, before any significant learning can have taken place, they must be considered wired in, i.e., genetically determined. In traditional biology textbooks, they are described as a concatenation of two things: a stimulus and a response, or a releaser and an action pattern.
Stimulus ---> Response (Activity)
Given that Piaget's interest had from the very beginning been focused on processes of adaptation, he saw very clearly that in order to become part of the general genetically determined characteristics of a species, these action patterns could be explained only as the result of natural selection. That is to say, organisms that manifested the reflexive action (because of accidental mutations) must have had a critical advantage over those that did not. Clearly this could not be due to the actions themselves but only to their result. He thus conceived of the reflex as consisting of three parts: A perceived situation, an activity associated with it, and a result of the activity which turned out to be beneficial for the actor.
The infant's rooting reflex, for instance, which makes the infant turn its head and search for something to suck whenever its cheek is touched, must have constituted a significant nutritional advantage. Individuals who did not have this automatic reaction, did not 'root' for the mother's breast, got an insufficient amount of milk, and were weeded out by natural selection.
Having constituted a three-part model of the reflex, it only needed the removal of the genetic fixedness in order to be applied to cognition. This, I am sure, was prompted by the simple observation that, at least in the higher mammals, most infantile fixed-action patterns are not as fixed as the biology textbooks would have it. In human animals, for example, the rooting reflex tends to disappear as their method of nutrition changes. Thus the reflex model could be adopted as explanatory tool in the domain of cognitively developed action and thought patterns that were in no way genetically determined. By
64

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
viewing it from the organism's own point of view, it became the 'action scheme' and the basic principle of sensorimotor learning.

1
Perceived Situation

Activity

3 Beneficial or Expected Result

Figure 3.1: Pattern of Action Scheme
This new perspective can be indicated by a change of terminology, and I have come to specify the three parts of schemes as follows:
I Recognition of a certain situation; 2 a specific activity associated with that situation; and 3 the expectation that the activity produces a certain previously experi-
enced result.
This tripartite pattern, I believe, is crucial for the proper understanding of the functioning of assimilation and accommodation.
The 'recognition' in part 1 is always the result of assimilation. An experiential situation is recognized as the starting-point of a scheme if it satisfies the conditions that have characterized it in the past. From an observer's point of view, it may manifest all sorts of differences relative to past situations that functioned as trigger, but the assimilating organism (e.g., the child) does not take these differences into account. If the experiential situation satisfies certain conditions, it triggers the associated activity.
Accommodation
The activity, part 2, then produces a result which the organism will attempt to assimilate to its expectation part 3. If the organism is unable to do this, there will be a perturbation (Piaget, 1974a, p.264). The perturbation, which may be either disappointment or surprise, may lead to all sorts of random reactions, but one among them seems particularly likely: if the initial situation 1 is still retrievable, it may now be reviewed, not as a compound triggering situation, but as a collection of sensory elements. This review may reveal characteristics that were disregarded by assimilation. If the unexpected outcome of the activity was disappointing, one or more of the newly noticed characteristics may effect a change in the recognition pattern and thus in the conditions that will trigger the activity in the future. Alternatively, if the unexpected outcome was pleasant or interesting, a new recognition pattern may be formed to include the new characteristic, and this will constitute a
65
82

Radical Constructivism
new scheme. In both cases there would be an act of learning and we would speak of an 'accommodation'. The same possibilities are opened, if the review reveals a difference in the performance of the activity, and this again could result in an accommodation.
Piaget's notion of scheme is not a simple affair. It cannot be properly understood unless one realizes that assimilation and accommodation are presumed to be subjective and depend on unobservable states in the particular cognizing agent. Assimilation has a generalizing effect in that it enables the agent to engage in a goal-directed action, even if, from the observer's point of view, the triggering situation is not quite the same as on previous occasions. If the goal is not achieved, the ensuing perturbation may lead to an accommodation. Either a new restrictive condition is added to the initial recognition process, which may serve in the future to prevent the particular 'unproductive' situation from triggering the activity. Or, if an unexpected result happens to be a desirable one, the added condition may serve to separate a new scheme from the old. In this case, the new condition will be central in the recognition pattern of the new scheme.
There is yet an added complication. The recognition of the activity's result 3 again depends on the particular pattern the agent has formed to recognize the results obtained in the course of prior experiences. That is to say, it, too, involves acts of assimilation.
Given this analysis, it is misleading to state, as do so many textbooks, that accommodation is simply the inverse of assimilation. In my interpretation of scheme theory, accommodation may take place only if a scheme does not yield the expected result. Hence it is largely determined by the cognizing agent's unobservable expectations, rather than by what an observer may call sensory 'input'.
Iii the context of accommodation, one might ask, what the situations are in which the child's schemes produce the perturbing outcomes that may impel it to learn. On the sensorimotor level, the permanent objects the child constructs, and the frequent interactions with them, continually provide innumerable opportunities to extend and refine the network of action patterns that constitute the 'physical' world. But the child's experiential world also comes to contain other people, and th' almost constant interaction with them is an even richer source of perturbation and consequent accommodations. Piaget has stressed many times that the most frequent cause of accommodation is the interaction, and especially linguistic interaction, with others. Yet he is often criticized for not having taken into account the social component. The critics usually contend that adults o teachers transmit knowledge to children and students by interacting with them, and that certain forms of knowledge are inherent in society and transferred directly from the group to the individual. However, what mechanism could effect such a transfer from person to person, has never been explained. (That language cannot perform this service, was suggested in the preceding chapter by de Saussure's analysis and will be explained in greater detail in Chapter 7.)
66

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing

The Concept of Equilibration

The notion of accommodation gives rise to an original theory of learning based on the concept of 'equilibration', a generic term for the elimination of perturbations. The focus on equilibration in his later work, is the reason why Piaget became interested in cybernetics (see Cellerier et al., 1968; Piaget,
1977b).
Any control system that works with negative feedback has the purpose of eliminating perturbations in order to keep some chosen value constant (see Chapter 8). Consequently homeostasis became a central theme in control engineering. Piaget, however, made very clear from the outset, that what had to be kept constant in the cognitive context, did not have to be a fixed value, e.g., a set temperature in a thermostat, or the sugar level in human blood. It was more often a relation between changing values (as the equilibrium of a cyclist) or the regular change in some function.
Cognitive development is characterized by expanding equilibration
(equilibration inajorante), a term by which Piaget means an increase in the range of perturbations the organism is able to eliminate. One aspect of this notion of expanding equilibration is interesting for the philosophy of science and, I believe, also for the teaching of science. Every time the cognizing subject manages to eliminate a novel perturbation it is possible and sometimes probable that the accommodation that achieved this equilibration turns out to have introduced a concept or operation that proves incompatible with concepts or operations that were established earlier and proved viable in the elimination of other perturbations. When such an inconsistency surfaces, it will itself create a perturbation on a higher conceptual level, namely the level on which reflection reviews and compares available schemes.' The higher-level perturbation may then require a reconstruction on a lower level, before a satisfactory equilibrium can be restored.
The history of science shows many examples of this kind. At present, for instance, theoretical physicists are considerably perturbed by the fact that a model based on the concept of waves, works very well for the phenomenon of light under certain circumstances, but is incompatible with the corpuscular theory that seems to be required to explain the results of other experiments.
There is a further aspect of equilibration which, although not explicitly stated, is implicit in Piaget's repeated observation that the most frequent occasions for accommodation are provided by interactions with others. Insofar as these accommodations eliminate perturbations, they generate equilibrium not only among the conceptual structures of the individual, but also in the domain of social interaction. Had Piaget emphasized this implicit corollary a little more, the superficial criticism that his model disregards the social element would have been largely avoided.
As this brief exposition shows, scheme theory, like any other scientific account, involves certain presuppositions. According to it, cognizing organ-
isms have to possess at least the following capabilities:

84

67

Radical Constructivzsm
The ability and, beyond it, the tendency to establish recurrences in the flow of experience; This, in turn, entails at least two further capabilities: remembering and retrieving (re-presenting) experiences, and the ability to make comparisons and judgments of similarity and difference; and The presupposition that the organism 'likes' certain experiences better than others; which is to say, it must have some elementary values.
These are features that clearly place Piaget's model in conflict with many twentieth-century psychologists, who diligently tried to avoid any reference to deliberate reflection, goal-directedness, and values.
Learning
The learning theory that emerges from Piaget's work can be summarized by saying that cognitive change and learning in a specific direction take place when a scheme, instead of producing the expected result, leads to perturbation, and perturbation, in turn, to an accommodation that maintains or reestablish :s equilibrium."
Learning and the knowledge it creates, thus, are explicitly instrumental. But here, again, it is crucial not to be rash or too simplistic in interpreting Piaget. His theory of cognition involves two kinds of 'viability' and therefore a twofold instrumentalism. On the sensorimotor level, viable action schemes are instrumental in helping organisms to achieve goals sensory equilibrium and survival in their interaction with the world they experience. On the level of reflective abstraction, however, operative schemes are instrumental in helping organisms achieve a relatively coherent conceptual network of structures that reflect the paths of acting as well as thinking, which, at their present point of experience, have turned out to be viable. The viability of concepts on this higher, more comprehensive level of abstraction is not measured by their practical value, but by their non-contradictory fit into the largest possible conceptual network. This aspect should put to rest the frequent complaint that constructivism undermines the practice of science. The first and essential criterion of viability on this second level is, indeed, analogous to what philosophers have called the 'coherence theory of truth', which concerns conceptual compatibility. Besides, just as in the case of scientific or philosophical models, other criteria, such as ease of handling, economy, simplicity, or what mathematicians call 'elegance', can be used to choose among models or theories that prove equally viable in the same set of circumstances.
The first kind of instrumentality might be called 'utilitarian' (the kind philosophers have traditionally scorned); the second, concerning conceptual coherence, is strictly epistemic and, as such, should be of some philosophical interest. It once more accentuates the radical shift in the conception of
68

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
knowledge, a shift that eliminates the paradoxical conception of 'Truth' that requires the unattainable ontological test.
The step that substitutes viability in the experiential world for correspondence with ontological reality, applies to knowledge that results from inductive inferences and generalizations. It does not affect deductive inferences in logic and mathematics. In Piaget's view, the certainty of conclusions in these areas pertains to mental operations and not to the results of schemes on the sensorimotor level (see Beth and Piaget 1961; Glasersfeld, 1985).
With regard to conceptual learning, I want to stress a feature that is rarely discussed. Once experiential elements can be re-presented and combined to form hypothetical situations that have not actually been experienced, it becomes possible to generate thought experiments of all kinds. They may start with simple questions, such as: what would happen if I did this or that? And they may regard the most sophisticated abstract problems of physics and mathematics. Insofar as their results can be applied and lead to viable outcomes in practice, thought experiments constitute what is perhaps the most powerful learning procedure in the cognitive domain.
Different Types of Abstraction
Throughout Piaget's work the distinction he makes between 'figurative' and `operative', and the concomitant distinction between (physical) 'acting' and (mental) 'operating', are indispensable for an understanding of his theoretical position.
`Figurative' refers to the domain of sensation and includes sensations generated by motion (kinaesthesia), by the metabolism of the organism (proprioception), and the composition of specific sensory data in perception. `Acting' refers to actions on that sensorimotor level, and it is observable because it involves sensory objects and physical motion. Any abstraction of patterns composed of specific sensory and/or motor signals is what Piaget calls 'empirical'. The object-concepts the child constructs by associatively combining sensorimotor signals, are therefore 'empirical abstractions'.
In contrast, any result of conceptual construction that does not depend on specific sensory material but is determined by what the subject does, is `operative' in Piaget's terminology. 'Operations', therefore, are always operations of the mind and, as such, not observable. Whatever results reflection upon these mental processes produces, are then called 'reflective abstraction'.' The material from which these abstractions are formed, consists of operations that the thinking subject itself performs and reflects upon. Hence there is an obvious analogy here to what Locke called the 'second source of ideas' (see Chapter 2).
There is one particular result of reflective abstraction that has been eminently fertile in the conceptual organization of our experiential world. Once a little reflection has recognized and isolated the basic procedure that in the
69

Radical Constructivism
past led to viable concepts of things and action schemes, this procedure can, as it were, be applied to itself. Put simply, this amounts to the following. The construction of object concepts and schemes is essentially inductive. By empirical abstraction, sensory particulars that recur in a number of experiential situations are retained and coordinated to form more or less stable patterns. These patterns are considered viable insofar as they serve to assimilate new experiences in a way that maintains or restores equilibrium. This simple form of the principle of induction, namely 'to retain what has functioned successfully in the past', can be abstracted and turned upon itself: because the inductive procedure has been a successful one, it may be advantageous to generate situations in which it could be employed. Consequently, a thinking subject that has reached this point by reflective abstraction and, for the time being, is not under pressure to cope with an actual problem, can imaginatively create material and generate reflective abstractions from it that may become useful in some future situation. This may involve material actually found in experience or it may take the form of a thought experiment with imaginary material.
Once the domain of the operative has been distinguished from that of the figurative, it becomes clear that the concept of object permanence is not an empirical but a reflective abstraction, because it does not derive from sensorimotor material but from the operative conceptual construct of individual identity.
The fact that this distinction was not, or not fully understood, underlies much of the controversy about the notorious Piagetian tasks. It has, for instance, been demonstrated innumerable times that not only a child but also a good many animals can be trained to react to the appearance of a given object in the same way they reacted to it before it disappeared. This indicates that the subject has formed a specific object concept (a figurative achievement); but it in no way proves, as is often claimed, that it constitutes a demonstration of the concept of object permanence (which is an operative achievement). To justify that second claim, it would be necessary to show (1) that the organism believes that the object in question 'exists' somewhere while it is not being experienced, and (2) that the organism is able to produce a re-presentation (i.e., a visualized image) of the object when it is not within the organism's actual perceptual field.'
The fundamental difference between the conventional psychologist's empirical approach and Piaget's is that the first focuses on observable behaviour and performance, whereas the second focuses on the results of reflectiv abstractions, that is, mental operations. Since these operations are never directly observable, they can only be inferred from observation. As a rule, such inferences arc not possible from a single observation but require a sequence stretched over time.
Any reference to mental operations does, of course, raise a formidablc problem the problem of consciousness. In Piaget's theory it crops up in various places, because the four capabilities 1 listed as presuppositions would

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
seem to require consciousness, at least at the higher stages of cognitive development. In Piaget's model, certain operations are sometimes said to be manifestly under the control of consciousness, at other times not. He has clearly shown this experimentally in several of his books (e.g., Piaget, 1974a, 1974b, 1977a), but the phenomenon of consciousness remains mysterious. He himself
said:
Psychology is not a science of consciousness, it is a science of behaviour! One studies behaviour, including the attainment of consciousness where one can get hold of it, but where one cannot, it is not a problem. (Bringuier, 1977, p.180, my emphasis)
In this he does not differ from other researchers. I know of no one today, who has produced a viable model of consciousness, yet we are mostly able to make reliable inferences as to when a human actor is conscious and when not.
Stages of Development
Piaget's theory has been correctly described as a 'stage theory' because it segments the cognitive development from birth to maturity into successive stages. In this regard, too, there are widespread misunderstandings. Given his genetic epistemology and its denial of the traditional notion that knowledge should be a picture of reality, it follows that, from his point of view, whatever theory a psychological investigator builds up, it will not be a description of the observed subjects' objective mental reality but rather a conceptual tool for systematizing the investigator's experiences with the subjects. All observation is necessarily structured by the observer and, as Piaget said:
I think that all structures are constructed and that the fundamental feature is the course of this construction: I think that nothing is given at the start, except some limiting points on which all the rest is based. The structures are neither given in advance in the human mind nor in the external world, as we perceive or organise it. (ibid., p.63)
The stage theory, therefore, should be taken for what it is, namely a more or less successful way of organizing an observer's view of developing children.
Apart from this, it must be said that Piaget changed his view, or rather his assessment of the importance of stages. At the beginning, he was inclined to believe that once an operation characterizing the next higher stage was manifested by the child's behaviour, this operation would be available to the child in all contexts where it might be relevant. This turned out not to be the case. The use of any given. mental operation is now considered far more context-dependent than was originally assumed. Hence it can take a certain time for a particular way of operating to spread to other contexts (horizontal

decalage). This means that a child may, for instance, have demonstrated 'formal operating' in a given context, while in other contexts it is still in a preceding stage. What has remained intact, however, is the Lssumption that there is a relatively fixed order in the acquisition of the operations that characterize the stages (vertical decalage).

The Observer and the Observed

One of the presuppositions of Piaget's theory is that the thinking subject has two basic capabilities. First, it can coordinate elements of sensory and motor
experience; second, if the conceptual structures resulting from such coordination turn out to be viable in further experiential situations, it is able to abstract, from its own operating, regularities and rules that may help to manage future experience. The elements the thinking subject coordinates are by definition present in the subject's system because they are 'experiential'. The system has no access to items which, from an observer's point of view, arc seen as external, 'environmental' causes of the system's experiences. Coordination, thus, is a strictly internal affair and, therefore, it is always subjective to the coordinator. This applies not only to the children Piaget was studying. but also to every observer, be it a scientist or a simple bystander. No one can escape this fundamental subjectivity of experience, and the philosophers who purport to have access to a 'God's eye view' are no exception." Like all cognizing organisms, they draw conclusions from their own sensorimotor
and conceptual experience, and any explanation of their conclusions, i.e., their 'knowledge', must be in terms of internal events and cannot draw on elements posited elsewhere.
Piaget made a clear distinction between the points of view, on the one hand, of the living, experiencing subject itself and, on the other, of the observer who is trying to understand how such a subject can construct
knowledge.

In the first place, one has to distinguish the individual subject, ... and
the epistemic subject or cognitive core that is common to all subjects at the same level. In the second place, one must contrast, on the one hand, the attainment of consciousness (which is always fragmentary and often distorting). and on the other, what the subject succeeds in doing in its intellectual activities of which it knows the results but not the mechanisms. But in dissociating the subject from the 'self' and what it 'lives', there remain its operations, that is to say, what it draws by reflective abstraction from the generalised coordinations of its actions. (Piaget, 1970b, p.120)

It is the observers who, in order to construct a model of cognition, 'dissociate' from the observed living subject what they categorize as coordinations

72

Piaget's Constructivist Theory of Knowing
and the results the subject draws from them by reflective abstraction. Only observers can refer to a subject's interaction with its environment and characterize the relation between the subject's structures (biological as well as conceptual) and the world in which, from an observer's point of view, the observed subject lives and operates.
Experience and Reality
In Piaget's model, then, the subject's interactive contacts with its environment are always and necessarily of the same kind: a conceptual structure fails be-
cause it does not lead to the result the subject has come to expect of it. Cognitive structures, it must be remembered, are tied to action and to use. Action and use are something more than random motion or random change
they take place in the context of 'action schemes'. This radically differentiates Piaget's approach from both the behaviourist's stimulusresponse approach and the physicist's linear causeeffect chains, because action schemes are explicitly goal-directed. As Piaget himself has occasionally suggested, action schemes are rather like feedback loops, because their inherent dual mechanisms of assimilation and accommodation make them self-regulating and therefore circular in that specific sense (the cybernetic parallel will be treated in Chapter 8).
The relation of knowledge to the real world, thus, is reciprocal in Piaget's model, because any conceptual structure is likely to be modified when it clashes with a constraint. To the thinking subject, the environment could manifest itself only through such clashes. The subject, therefore, can know no more than that certain structures and schemes have clashed with constraints, while others constitute a viable way of managing.
This is analogous to saying that the biological organisms that are alive at a given moment, are viable because they have so far managed to survive. To infer from this relation a likeness or 'correspondence' would be a non sequitur and a gross misrepresentation. Having avoided clashes with obstacles does not tell us what the obstacles are and how a reality consisting of them might be structured. The experience of a clash or failure merely tells us that, under the particular experiential circumstances, the particular scheme did riot work. The failure, moreover, may be due, not to the world but to a snag or contradiction intrinsic to the scheme. lf, instead, a scheme is successful, this merely shows it to be viable in that it 'worked'. No inference about a 'real' world can be drawn from this viability, because a countless number of other schemes might have worked as well.
The most important consequence of this model of cognition, can be summarized as follows. Our knowledge of clashes with what we have categorized as 'environment' or 'real world' can be articulated and re-presented only in terms of viable conceptual structures, i.e., structures which, themselves, have not come into contact with obstacles. At best, then, this knowledge of clashes

and failures describes reality in 'negative' terms. Any notion that cognitive structures could come to reflect ontological reality e.g., that we could discover the ontic shape of things by sliding our senses or measuring instruments along the surfaces of things-in-themselves and thus plot deliberate contacts is an illusion. The space and time in which we move, measure and, above all, in which we map our movements and operations, are our own construction, and no explanation that relies on them can transcend our experiential world.
In short, the epistemological view which I find to be the most compatible with Piaget's work is an instrumentalist one in which knowledge does not mean knowledge of an experiencer-independent world. From this perspective, cognitive structures action schemes. concepts, rules, theories, and laws are evaluated primarily by the criterion of success, and success must ultimately be understood in terms of the organisms' efforts to gain, maintain, and extend its internal equilibrium in the face of perturbations.
Conclusion
This attempt to lay out some of the key concepts in Piaget's model of cognition and cognitive development is far from complete. I have tried to focus on those points which, it seems to me, are most important yet frequently misrepresented and misunderstood.
As I suggested at the beginning, Piaget's writings do contain contradictions. But if one searches his work for all that can be incorporated in a consistent model of human knowing, one does, I believe, come to the conclusion that the occasional passages that imply a realist stance are nothing but slips of mind. In all his pioneering he may every now and then have lapsed into the ordinary, current ways of speaking that belong to the traditional epistemology he was struggling to overcome.

5 The Baccalaureate is conferred at the successful termination of high school. 6 It is important to realize that the neural network is constantly teeming with signals
that originate in the peripheral neurones that are usually called 'receptors' or 'sensory organs'. While you are reading this, there are innumerable signals available to you to which you are not attending; e.g., some that you would call 'tactual' that originate in your rump and which you could interpret as telling you that you are sitting; others that originate in your ears and which you could interpret as telling you that a car is passing in the street; but your attention was focused on this text and therefore you were not doing any of this other interpreting before I mentioned the possibility. Similarly, literally millions of signals are constantly generated in the retinas of your eyes, but you disregard almost all of them because you are focusing your attention on 'some specific thing', i.e., a coordination of signals that is of interest and 'makes sense' to you at the moment. 7 Psychologists might call this 'constancy', but I prefer the somewhat archaic word 'perdurance' to distinguish the purely conceptual notion from the perceptual 'constancies'. 8 This, clearly, is a conceptual affair and not a matter of observable actions. It can be ascertained in the course of interaction, but not by simply recording behavioural responses. This has frequently been misunderstood by developmental psychologists who were looking for observable manifestations of 'object permanence' in children, and by animal psychologists who attempted to demonstrate it in animals. 9 The French word is scheme and it refers to a Scheme of actions or operations. Unfortunately it has often been translated as 'schema' (plural 'schemata') which corresponds to the French word schema, a word rarely found in Piaget's texts because it refers to static diagrams such as town plans or flow charts. By disregarding the difference, translators have caused considerable confusion among English readers. 10 Note that this reflective review of available schemes anticipated and included the capability for which contemporary psychologists have invented the term 'metacognition'. 11 Needless to say, there is also a great deal of accidental learning that arises from the perturbations generated by unexpected sequences of experience. 12 Piaget divided this form of abstraction into four categories (1977); they will be discussed in Chapter 5. 13 With 2-year-old children (and sometimes younger ones) there is an intermediate indication that the concept of object permanence is about to be achieved: the infant, not having found the object in three of the four known hiding places, shows by expression and body language that it knows the object will be in the last one. 14 This expression is Hilary Putnam's (1981).

Chapter 4
The Construction of Concepts'
As I described at the beginning of this book, my interest in theories of knowledge was triggered by the use of different languages and the early discovery that each was tied to a different experiential world. At the same time it seemed that they all functioned in much the same way, and I began to look for a model for the stuff that we call 'meaning'.
Sensorimotor knowledge manifests itself in actions, but conceptual knowledge is expressed in symbols. When we come to investigate this know-
ledge, the symbols are mostly linguistic. Therefore, semantic analysis, i.e., the analysis of meaning, has to be an important facet of any theory of knowing.
The relation between conceptual structures and their linguistic expressions was also at the heart of the Italian Operationist School, and Ceccato's method for the analysis of meaning came to play an important role in the development of the constructivist theory. I called it 'conceptual semantics' and continued to use it during my work on machine translation. It is an unconventional method and differs sharply from the common practice in linguistics. It does not try to find appropriate verbal definitions of words, as one 'night find in a dictionary, but instead, aims at providing 'recipes' that specify the mental operations that are required to obtain a particular concept. It was a sophisticated application of Bridgman's idea of operational definition. One might be tempted to speak of an analysis of mental behaviour but, given current usage, this would be counterproductive.
In the United States, where I have been living for the last quarter of a century, psychology has chosen to define itself as the science of behaviour
and behaviour, as the followers of Watson and Skinner preached with devastating success, is what we can observe an organism do. The founders of behaviourism were adamant in their contention that there is nothing beyond the observable that could be of interest to science.' Focusing exclusively on behaviour and defining behaviour as observable responses, makes it easy to avoid dealing with any intelligent organism's more complex capabilities. In the long run, it provides merely partial models of the behaviour of pigeons and rats.
Piaget, too, described psychology as the science of behaviour (see Chapter 3), but it was for 3 different reason. Behaviour was important to Piaget, because an observer can often infer from it what might be going on in another person's mind, and the functioning of the mind was his primary interest.

The Construction of Concepts

Among the most intriguing human activities that can never be directly observed is thinking or reflecting. At times one can infer thoughts or reflections from a facial expression or a position as Rodin hoped when he moulded his Penseur and sometimes one might infer them from subsequent acts of speech-or other actions. But the actual process of thinking remains invisible and so. do the concepts it uses and the raw material of which they are composed..
Adult human beings, however, usually speak some language, and this entail's that most, if not all, their concepts have to be associated with words. This opens a window on conceptual structures. Speakers of a language can examine concepts they habitually employ in thinking. Not by direct introspection, but by imagining a variety of related situations and asking themselves: 'what word would fit, if I wanted to describe this particular part or aspect of my experience'.
William James, whose powerful analytic mind often focused on problems of meaning, told a delightful story that provides a vivid illustration of conceptual analysis:
Some years ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I returned from a solitary ramble to find every one engaged in a fero-
cious metaphysical dispute. The corpus of the dispute was a squirrel a live squirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the tree's opposite side a human being was imagined to stand. This human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how fast he goes, the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction and always keeps the tree between himself and the man, so that never a glimpse of him is caught.' The resultant metaphysical problem now is this: Does the man go round the squirrel or not? He goes round the tree, sure enough, and the squirrel is on the tree; but does he go round the squirrel? In the unlimited leisure of the wilderness, discussion had been worn threadbare. Everyone had taken sides, and was obstinate; and the numbers on both sides were even. Each side, when I appeared, therefore appealed to me to make it a majority. Mindful of the scholastic adage that whenever you meet a contradiction you must make a distinction, I immediately sought and found one, as follows: 'Which party is right', I said, 'depends on what you practically mean by "going round" the squirrel. If you mean passing from the north of him to the cast,
then to the south, then to the west, and then to the north of him again, obviously the man does go round him, for he occupies these successive positions. But if on the contrary you mean being first in front of him, then on the right of him, then behind him, then on his
left, and finally in front again, it is quite as obvious that the man fails to go round him, for by the compensating movements the squirrel makes, he keeps his belly turned towards the man all the time, and

his back turned away. Make the distinction, and there is no occasion for any farther dispute. You are both right and both wrong according as you conceive the verb "to go round" in one practical fashion or the other.' ( James, 1907/1955, pp.41-2)
The analysis of the experiential situation is 'logical' and it brings to the surface a difference of conceptualization that is blurred by the ordinary use of language. The possibility of bringing such distinctions to awareness by examining the meaning of words, was the starting point that Silvio Ceccato's group chose for their conceptual analyses in the 1940s. But Ceccato had added a second question that led the enterprise beyond language and into the very domain of thought: 'what mental operations must be carried out to see the presented situation in the particular way one is seeing it'. This was the first serious application of the method the Nobel laureate Bridgman (1936) had called 'operational definition'. When this method was first published, it created quite a stir in Bridgman's field of theoretical physics. A decade or so later, the psychological establishment picked up the part of Bridgman's idea that focused on physical operations. All that concerned abstractions was suppressed. As a result, we have the appalling slogan, 'Intelligence is what the intelligence test measures', a slogan that caused innumerable gifted children all over the world to be hopelessly misjudged.
Bridgman had something more sophisticated in mind. Speaking of mathematics, he explicitly said that we can also construct concepts in other ways and then experiment with them
. . to see whether the concepts are useful. We still have operational meaning for our concepts, but the operations are mental operations, and have no necessary physical validity . . . But even mental operations are subject to certain limitations, and if we transgress these in formulating our tentative concepts we may expect trouble. In particular all mental operations must be made in time, and are therefore ordered in time. (Bridgman, 1936/1964, p.11)
In Bridgman's work one finds examples of physical operations, such as measuring the distance between two points by successively placing a meter on the line that connects them. Of the mental operations he gives some results, but he does not specify how he imagined them to work. This is the point that Ceccato pursued. He came up with a model of a mental procedure based on the notion of a pulsating attention and the ability to form combinatorial patterns of such pulses. (This will be explained in more detail in the section on the conception of number, in Chapter 9).
For the somewhat grosser level of analysis used for the non-mathematical concepts I want to present here, it will be sufficient to say that Ceccato's
78
95

The Construction of Concepts
method consisted in viewing sensory experience much like a cinema film, made up of a sequence of still 'frames' that give rise to concepts of change, movement, extension, etc., when they are presented in rapid continuous succession.'
Analysis of Operations
In the preceding chapter, mental operations were shown to be an integral part of Piaget's theory. They are the basic element of reflective abstractions and of everything Piaget's theory subsumes under the term 'operative'. Thus we now have three authors who speak of mental operations and, of course, there are differences. Bridgman must be acknowledged for establishing the thinking subject's non-physical operations as a respectable topic for investigation. The distinction was the important feature for him, rather than any functional details of the mind.
For Piaget, mental operations are either 'abstraction' (`empirical', when abstraction is made from sensorimotor material, 'reflective', when it concerns the subject's own activity) or 'logical transformation' (changing the relations that characterize a group structure). In contrast to both, Ceccato's idea of successive pulses of attention provides a mechanism, a hypothetical model of how the mind might operate. Although the three conceptions are not interchangeable they overlap insofar as they refer to the mind's activity, and are mutually compatible in my interpretation. The authors are speaking about different levels of analysis. Bridgman classified concepts as he found them; Piaget examined their logical character as elements of cognition; and Ceccato analysed them from the perspective of a technician who intends to build a functioning model of the adult mind.
As far as one can tell, Bridgman had no contact whatever with the two other authors. Piaget was well aware of Bridgman's work and explicitly referred to it (see Piaget, 1957, p.7). He also met Ceccato at least once and
included him in the original editorial committee of the Etudes d'epistemologie genetique, a chain of thirty-seven publications that continued until 1980. However, given the lack of a common language and an apparent clash of personalities, they never came around to discussing the fundamental ideas they could have agreed on.
In my view, it is something of a tragedy that Piaget and Ceccato could not work together. Ceccato's model of the functioning of attention is just the sort of thing that is needed to underpin Piaget's crucial notion of abstraction. It might have opened the path to neurophysiological experimentation which would have provided a welcome connection between Piaget's theoretical model and empirical research. But this is not what I want to discuss here. Rather, I want to present some results of conceptual analysis by means of Ceccato's model of successive frames.

The Concept of Change
One of the conceptual structures that plays a major role in providing a fit with our experiential world, is the concept referred to by the word 'change'. Though we cannot watch how a language-user builds up his or her concepts, we can investigate them by doing two things. First, examine what kind of situations the word is intended to describe; second, try to unravel, from a logical point of view, what elements the associated concept must incorporate in order adequately to reflect certain experiential situations. If we do this with the concept of change, we can say straightaway that we would not have occasion to conceive of change if we had no memory. In order to speak of change, we have to consider at least two moments of experience and spot a difference.
This need of more than one experience was implicit already in Zeno's paradox of the arrow. If you watch an arrow flying through the air, you see it move and change place from the moment it leaves the bow to the moment it hits the target. If, however, you consider it at any one moment during its flight, it does not move. Zeno knew nothing of movies, but what we today have in the form of cinema film is a perfect illustration of what he was suggesting. A film showing the flying arrow would be made up of a series of still frames. Each frame would show a stationary arrow at a slightly different place. If we saw only a single frame, we might guess that the arrow was moving, but this would be an inference made by analogy to other experiences we have had of arrows. The single frame itself contains no movement.
This is no new revelation. Jeremy Bentham stated it clearly:
When of any body it is said: 'That body has been in motion', what is meant is that, at or in different portions of the field of time, that body has occupied different portions in the field of space. (Bentham, in Ogden, 1959, p.115)
Knowledge oldie movement must be constructed by the observer in his or her field of experience. Notice that I am concerned with knowledge of the movement, not with the question of whether or not the 'real' arrow moves. The cinema film is a good illustration, precisely because on it the arrow does not move. Yet when we see the film projected, we see the movement. Thus the question arises: how can this experience he generated?
The analysis must begin with the fact that we need at least two consecutive experiential frames. Ceccato's method consists in mapping the minimum requirements for each frame. We therefore mark two moments of the experiential flow: t, and t2.
To speak of 'change', we also need the perception or conception of a difference. For example, a difference of colour, shape, size, location, or the like. If the frames contain a background, the arrow's location can be defined relative to some other visible item; if nothing else is shown, it can be defined only in relation to the edges of the frame. If the two frames showed the arrow
80
97

The Construction of Concepts
in the same place, you could not say that it was moving. A difference in location by itself, however, is not enough it has to be attributed to some thing of which, as in the case of the arrow, we can then say that it has moved.
If, instead of an arrow, I showed you a small green plum and then another larger purple one, you would not be inclined to speak of change. But if the green plum were on a tree, and a few weeks later you looked at it again and saw the same plum purple, you might say that its colour has changed or, indeed, that it has ripened. In other words, the concept of 'change' requires a difference perceived in an object that is considered the same object at two moments in the flow of experience.
But sameness, as I explained in the context of 'object permanence', is not as simple a notion as it might seem.
William James anticipated the crucial distinction to be made:
Permanent 'things' again; the 'same' thing and its various 'appearances' and 'alterations'; the different 'kinds' of thing . . . it is only the smallest part of his experience's flux that anyone actually does straighten out by applying to it these conceptual instruments. Out of them all our lowest ancestors probably used only, and then most vaguely and inaccurately, the notion of 'the same again'. But even then if you had asked them whether the same were a 'thing' that had endured throughout the unseen interval, they would probably have been at a loss, and would have said that they had never asked that
question, or considered matters in that light. ( James, 1907/1955, p.119)
Many of our contemporaries have not considered that question either. The sameness that you might ascribe to the wine glasses on a dinner table or to the chairs around it, would be the sameness of 'equivalence' and it would not lead you to speak of change. The sameness involved in the construction of the concept of change has to be 'individual identity'. That is to say, the thing about which we want to say it has changed, must be the self-same individual in both frames.
I can now complete the schematic representation of the concept, indicating the arrow by 'X' and marking its different locations. The fact that the X refers to the self-same arrow in subsequent frames (individual identity) is shown by an equal sign with three, instead of two lines.

Radical Constructivism
In the example of the plum, the structure of the change-diagram would be similar, but instead of locations, which determine change in the arrow experience, different colours would be associated with X at t, and t2.
The Concept of Motion
The case of motion, however, is more complicated. Not because the diagram does not represent the core of the concept adequately, but because, on the one hand, it does not specify what kind of motion one has in mind, and on the other, the words that refer to the concept are often used loosely. The diagram, for instance, shows that the arrow moved, but it does not specify whether it did so because it was shot from a bow or because the archer carried it in his quiver from location A to location B. Thus, when we used this method for the analysis of specific pieces of `language' or text, it had to be expanded to include conventional ways of indicating contextual features. What I called 'looseness', however, concerns the use of concepts and frequently does reflect features that are relevant to conceptual analysis.
Let us assume that one of the situations to be examined in the course of the investigation of the concept of motion, would be described by the phrase `This bus goes from Exeter to London'. It could at once be represented by the above diagram, because the locations A and B can easily be specified respectively as Exeter and London, and X could stand for the bus. But what if the description were `This road goes from Exeter to London.'? Now it does not seem to involve any motion. You might shrug your shoulders and conclude once again that the way language is used is not a logical affair.
As it happened, this example, and others like it, played an important role in the conceptual analyses we carried out in the 1960s and, as far as I am concerned, it helped in the development of the constructivisr model of cognition. The attempt to explain it highlights a crucial aspect of mental operations.
In order to understand the `meaning' of the phrase 'This road goes to London', you have to bring forth, as in the first case, an image (i.e., a representation) which, at the moment, is your interpretation of the word `London'. It may be your image of Trafalgar Square, a particular London pub, or the bus terminal. Whatever it happens to be, it will be a location different from the location of Exeter. The expression `goes to' still indicates a change of place but no likely agent of actual physical motion is specified. Yet, the concept of `road' implies unlimited extension in one dimension, the spatial connection of locations, and the possibility of travel. This is sufficient for the reader to transform the displacement of attention from `Exeter' to 'London' into the potential motion of a physical object.
Linguists and philosophers of language have long come around to the idea that the meaning of words depends to a large extent on the context in
82
D9

The Construction of Concepts

which they are found. In fact, a word, as Roland Barthes said of literature in

general: 'sets up ambiguities, not a meaning' (Barthes, 1987, p.72). There is

hardly ever a simple one-to-one relation between a word and a concept.

Prepositions are a good example (see the different uses of the English 'by'

listed in Chapter 1). One way to think of this relative looseness is to think

of mental operations as tools that serve to establish basic relations between

elements of experience. The basic relations are then further specified by the

given context. One could say, for example, that 'by' designates, among other

things, the relation of closeness in space or time and that it is the context that

determines in instances such as `by the river' and `by Friday' whether the

closeness is to be visualized as proximity or coincidence in space or time; and

in instances such as `by force' and `by moonlight', as the more specific relation

of means and ends. In principle, this is similar to the case of the bus and the

road: the one implies actual change of place, the other potential travel.

The different interpretations that contexts can elicit for. a word. however,

are frequently not all the same for the word of another language, even if that

word seems to be similar in many respects. A little story may illustrate this.

One Sunday, I was walking with an English friend along a river in the coun-

tryside near Milan. For a short stretch railway tracks followed the river, and

we had to cross them into a field. There a family, complete with mamma and

bambini had spread out a picnic and the children were running about in the
