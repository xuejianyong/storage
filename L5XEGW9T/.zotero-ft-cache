Introduction (cont’)
 Context-aware computing is a mobile computing paradigm
 Applications can discover and take advantage of contextual information
 Context-aware Computing
 Brings us one step closer to the Pervasive Computing vision  Enables computer systems to anticipate users’ needs and to act in advance  An emerging paradigm to free everyday users from manually configuring
and instructing computer systems
6 / 25

Definition of “Context”
 In Merriam-Webster Dictionary
 the interrelated condition in which something exists or occurs
 In context-aware computing
 No unified definition of context  Most of the definitions agree that context has something to do with the
interactions between the users and the computing systems
7 / 25

Definition of “Context” (cont’)
 Three categories (Schilit) + one
 Computing context  network connectivity  communication cost, communication bandwidth  nearby resource
 User context  user profile, location, social situation
 Physical context  lighting, noise, traffic condition, temperature
 Time context  Time of a day, week, month and season of the year
8 / 25

Definition of “Context” (cont’)
 Schmidt et al
 “Knowledge about the user’s and IT device’s state, including surroundings, situation, and to a less extent, location”
 Dey
 "Any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves“
 Context is the set of environmental states and settings that either determines an application’s behavior or in which an application event occurs and is interesting to the user.

Context-Aware Computing
 Four Categories (Schilit)
 Proximate selection  a user-interface technique where the objects located nearby are emphasized or otherwise made easier to choose.
 Automatic contextual reconfiguration  a process of adding new components, removing existing components, or altering the connections between components due to context changes.
 Contextual information and commands  which can produce different results according to the context in which they are issued.
 Context-triggered actions  simple IF-THEN rules used to specify how context-aware systems should adapt.
10 / 25

Context-Aware Computing (cont’)
 Author
 Active context awareness  an application automatically adapts to discovered context, by changing the application’s behavior
 Passive context awareness  an application presents the new or updated context to an interested user or makes the context persistent for the user to retrieve later
 Active context awareness is more interesting

Context-Aware Application
 Call Forwarding  Teleporting  Active Map  Mobisaic Web Browser  Shopping Assistant  Cyberguide  Conference Assistant  …………
12 / 25

Context-Aware Application (cont’)

 Call Forwarding System

A user has left his office

The phone rings in his office

The system detects his current location

The system forwards the call to a nearby
phone

The system detects the user is in an meeting

Calls are forwarded to his voice mailbox

13 / 25

Context-Aware Application (cont’)

 Call Forwarding System
 Three types of contexts are used:
The system detects his current location

Location Context

The system detects the user is in an meeting

Activity Context

Context-Aware Application (cont’)

 Shopping Assistant System

A user enters a store

Turns on his PDA

PDA displays the info

of a store item

+

+

=

As the user wonders around in the store

PDA analyzes user’s personal profile

PDA recommends store items to the user

Sensing the Context
 Sensing the Location  Sensing Low-level Contexts Beyond Location  Sensing High-level Contexts  Sensing Context Changes
17 / 25

Sensing the Context (cont’)
 Sensing Location
 Outdoors  Global Positioning System (GPS)  GPS-less Low Cost Outdoor Localization For Very Small Devices
 Indoors  Ultrasonic and radio signals “The Cricket”  RADAR, Active Floor and Smart Floor
 Hybrid  based on network domains  Mobile-IP protocol
 Issues  no uniform way to track locations with fine granularity that works both indoors and outdoors  context sensed from different sensors may conflict to each other.
18 / 25

Sensing the Context (cont’)
 Sensing Low-level Contexts Beyond Location
 Time  Nearby objects  Network bandwidth  Orientation  Other low-level contexts:
 light level, sound ………
 Sensing High-level Contexts
 Such as user’s activity
19 / 25

Modeling Context Information
 Location Model Purpose
 To handle object mobility  To facilitate location-related queries
 Two Location Model
 Symbolic Model  representing location as abstract symbols
 Geometric Model  representing location as coordinates
 Both model can convert to each other via pre-defined predicates
20 / 25

Modeling Context Information (cont’)
 Data Structure
 Key-value pairs  Key - Environmental variable, Value - context
 Tagged encoding.  SGML – standard generic markup language  <body>   　<require>
 Object-oriented model  GUIDE system
 Logic-based model  expresses the existing contextual information in a domain-centralized database using an entity-relationship data model.
 Others………
21 / 25

System Infrastructure
 It is necessary to decouple the application and the actual context sensing part
 A middleware layer whose can translate raw sensor information to an application-understandable format
 Centralized
 Location Information Server at Phillip  Centralized maintenance of contexts  Scalability problem
 Distributed
 Rome system at Stanford  More privacy  Increased computation and communication
22 / 25

Security and Privacy
 There are two key problems in context-aware system security
 Ensure the accuracy of location information and identities  Establish secret communications
 “Perfect” privacy guarantees are in general hard and expensive
 User should be able to have the control over their contextual information and over who may gain access to it
23 / 25

Summary
 Research of accurately discovering context, efficiently disseminating contextual information, and making use of the available context, are still at the early stages
 Context awareness is a key factor for new applications in the area of ubiquitous computing
