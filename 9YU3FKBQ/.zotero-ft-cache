The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6–8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.
We set out to create a single algorithm that would be able to develop
a wide range of competencies on a varied range of challenging tasks—a central goal of general artificial intelligence13 that has eluded previous efforts8,14,15. To achieve this, we developed a novel agent, a deep Q-network
(DQN), which is able to combine reinforcement learning with a class of artificial neural network16 known as deep neural networks. Notably, recent advances in deep neural networks9–11, in which several layers of
nodes are used to build up progressively more abstract representations
of the data, have made it possible for artificial neural networks to learn
concepts such as object categories directly from raw sensory data. We
use one particularly successful architecture, the deep convolutional network17, which uses hierarchical layers of tiled convolutional filters
to mimic the effects of receptive fields—inspired by Hubel and Wiesel’s seminal work on feedforward processing in early visual cortex18—thereby
exploiting the local spatial correlations present in images, and building
in robustness to natural transformations such as changes of viewpoint
or scale.
We consider tasks in which the agent interacts with an environment
through a sequence of observations, actions and rewards. The goal of the

Reinforcement learning is known to be unstable or even to diverge

when a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network is

used to represent the action-value (also known as Q) function20. This

instability has several causes: the correlations present in the sequence

of observations, the fact that small updates to Q may significantly change

the policy and therefore change the data distribution, and the correlations

between the action-values (Q) and the target values zc max Qð 0, 0Þ.

We address these instabilities with a novel variant of Q-learaning, which

uses two key ideas. First, we used a biologically inspired mechanism

termed experience replay21–23 that randomizes over the data, thereby

removing correlations in the observation sequence and smoothing over

changes in the data distribution (see below for details). Second, we used

an iterative update that adjusts the action-values (Q) towards target

values that are only periodically updated, thereby reducing correlations

with the target.

While other stable methods exist for training neural networks in the

reinforcement learning setting, such as neural fitted Q-iteration24, these

methods involve the repeated training of networks de novo on hundreds of iterations. Consequently, these methods, unlike our algorithm, are

too inefficient to be used successfully with large neural networks. We

parameterize an approximate value function Q( , ;h ) using the deep sa i

convolutional neural network shown in Fig. 1, in which hi are the param-

eters (that is, weights) of the Q-network at iteration i. To perform

difficult and engaging for human players. We used the same network architecture, hyperparameter values (see Extended Data Table 1) and learning procedure throughout—taking high-dimensional data (210|160 colour video at 60 Hz) as input—to demonstrate that our approach robustly learns successful policies over a variety of games based solely on sensory inputs with only very minimal prior knowledge (that is, merely the input data were visual images, and the number of actions available in each game, but not their correspondences; see Methods). Notably, our method was able to train large neural networks using a reinforcement learning signal and stochastic gradient descent in a stable manner— illustrated by the temporal evolution of two indices of learning (the agent’s average score-per-episode and average predicted Q-values; see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Discussion for details).

We compared DQN with the best performing methods from the reinforcement learning literature on the 49 games where results were available12,15. In addition to the learned agents, we also report scores for a professional human games tester playing under controlled conditions and a policy that selects actions uniformly at random (Extended Data Table 2 and Fig. 3, denoted by 100% (human) and 0% (random) on
y axis; see Methods). Our DQN method outperforms the best existing reinforcement learning methods on 43 of the games without incorporating any of the additional prior knowledge about Atari 2600 games used by other approaches (for example, refs 12, 15). Furthermore, our DQN agent performed at a level that was comparable to that of a professional human games tester across the set of 49 games, achieving more than 75% of the human score on more than half of the games (29 games;

outperforms competing methods (also see Extended Data Table 2) in almost all the games, and performs at a level that is broadly comparable with or superior to a professional human games tester (that is, operationalized as a level of 75% or above) in the majority of games.

see Fig. 3, Supplementary Discussion and Extended Data Table 2). In additional simulations (see Supplementary Discussion and Extended Data Tables 3 and 4), we demonstrate the importance of the individual core components of the DQN agent—the replay memory, separate target Q-network and deep convolutional network architecture—by disabling them and demonstrating the detrimental effects on performance.
We next examined the representations learned by DQN that underpinned the successful performance of the agent in the context of the game Space Invaders (see Supplementary Video 1 for a demonstration of the performance of DQN), by using a technique developed for the visualization of high-dimensional data called ‘t-SNE’25 (Fig. 4). As expected, the t-SNE algorithm tends to map the DQN representation of perceptually similar states to nearby points. Interestingly, we also found instances in which the t-SNE algorithm generated similar embeddings for DQN representations of states that are close in terms of expected reward but

perceptually dissimilar (Fig. 4, bottom right, top left and middle), consistent with the notion that the network is able to learn representations that support adaptive behaviour from high-dimensional sensory inputs. Furthermore, we also show that the representations learned by DQN are able to generalize to data generated from policies other than its own—in simulations where we presented as input to the network game states experienced during human and agent play, recorded the representations of the last hidden layer, and visualized the embeddings generated by the t-SNE algorithm (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Discussion). Extended Data Fig. 2 provides an additional illustration of how the representations learned by DQN allow it to accurately predict state and action values.
It is worth noting that the games in which DQN excels are extremely varied in their nature, from side-scrolling shooters (River Raid) to boxing games (Boxing) and three-dimensional car-racing games (Enduro).

Figure 4 | Two-dimensional t-SNE embedding of the representations in the last hidden layer assigned by DQN to game states experienced while playing Space Invaders. The plot was generated by letting the DQN agent play for 2 h of real game time and running the t-SNE algorithm25 on the last hidden layer
representations assigned by DQN to each experienced game state. The
points are coloured according to the state values (V, maximum expected reward
of a state) predicted by DQN for the corresponding game states (ranging
from dark red (highest V) to dark blue (lowest V)). The screenshots
corresponding to a selected number of points are shown. The DQN agent

predicts high state values for both full (top right screenshots) and nearly complete screens (bottom left screenshots) because it has learned that completing a screen leads to a new screen full of enemy ships. Partially completed screens (bottom screenshots) are assigned lower state values because less immediate reward is available. The screens shown on the bottom right and top left and middle are less perceptually similar than the other examples but are still mapped to nearby representations and similar values because the orange bunkers do not carry great significance near the end of a level.

Indeed, in certain games DQN is able to discover a relatively long-term strategy (for example, Breakout: the agent learns the optimal strategy, which is to first dig a tunnel around the side of the wall allowing the ball to be sent around the back to destroy a large number of blocks; see Supplementary Video 2 for illustration of development of DQN’s performance over the course of training). Nevertheless, games demanding more temporally extended planning strategies still constitute a major challenge for all existing agents including DQN (for example, Montezuma’s Revenge).
In this work, we demonstrate that a single architecture can successfully learn control policies in a range of different environments with only very minimal prior knowledge, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, and using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters on each game, privy only to the inputs a human player would have. In contrast to previous work24,26, our approach incorporates ‘end-to-end’ reinforcement learning that uses reward to continuously shape representations within the convolutional network towards salient features of the environment that facilitate value estimation. This principle draws on neurobiological evidence that reward signals during perceptual learning may influence the characteristics of representations within primate visual cortex27,28. Notably, the successful integration of reinforcement learning with deep network architectures was critically dependent on our incorporation of a replay algorithm21–23 involving the storage and representation of recently experienced transitions. Convergent evidence suggests that the hippocampus may support the physical

realization of such a process in the mammalian brain, with the timecompressed reactivation of recently experienced trajectories during offline periods21,22 (for example, waking rest) providing a putative mechanism by which value functions may be efficiently updated through interactions with the basal ganglia22. In the future, it will be important to explore the potential use of biasing the content of experience replay towards salient events, a phenomenon that characterizes empirically observed hippocampal replay29, and relates to the notion of ‘prioritized sweeping’30 in reinforcement learning. Taken together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with biologically inspired mechanisms to create agents that are capable of learning to master a diverse array of challenging tasks.

METHODS
Preprocessing. Working directly with raw Atari 2600 frames, which are 210 3 160 pixel images with a 128-colour palette, can be demanding in terms of computation and memory requirements. We apply a basic preprocessing step aimed at reducing the input dimensionality and dealing with some artefacts of the Atari 2600 emulator. First, to encode a single frame we take the maximum value for each pixel colour value over the frame being encoded and the previous frame. This was necessary to remove flickering that is present in games where some objects appear only in even frames while other objects appear only in odd frames, an artefact caused by the limited number of sprites Atari 2600 can display at once. Second, we then extract the Y channel, also known as luminance, from the RGB frame and rescale it to 84 3 84. The function w from algorithm 1 described below applies this preprocessing to the m most recent frames and stacks them to produce the input to the Q-function, in which m 5 4, although the algorithm is robust to different values of m (for example, 3 or 5). Code availability. The source code can be accessed at https://sites.google.com/a/ deepmind.com/dqn for non-commercial uses only. Model architecture. There are several possible ways of parameterizing Q using a neural network. Because Q maps history–action pairs to scalar estimates of their Q-value, the history and the action have been used as inputs to the neural network by some previous approaches24,26. The main drawback of this type of architecture is that a separate forward pass is required to compute the Q-value of each action, resulting in a cost that scales linearly with the number of actions. We instead use an architecture in which there is a separate output unit for each possible action, and only the state representation is an input to the neural network. The outputs correspond to the predicted Q-values of the individual actions for the input state. The main advantage of this type of architecture is the ability to compute Q-values for all possible actions in a given state with only a single forward pass through the network.
The exact architecture, shown schematically in Fig. 1, is as follows. The input to the neural network consists of an 84 3 84 3 4 image produced by the preprocessing map w. The first hidden layer convolves 32 filters of 8 3 8 with stride 4 with the input image and applies a rectifier nonlinearity31,32. The second hidden layer convolves 64 filters of 4 3 4 with stride 2, again followed by a rectifier nonlinearity. This is followed by a third convolutional layer that convolves 64 filters of 3 3 3 with stride 1 followed by a rectifier. The final hidden layer is fully-connected and consists of 512 rectifier units. The output layer is a fully-connected linear layer with a single output for each valid action. The number of valid actions varied between 4 and 18 on the games we considered. Training details. We performed experiments on 49 Atari 2600 games where results were available for all other comparable methods12,15. A different network was trained on each game: the same network architecture, learning algorithm and hyperparameter settings (see Extended Data Table 1) were used across all games, showing that our approach is robust enough to work on a variety of games while incorporating only minimal prior knowledge (see below). While we evaluated our agents on unmodified games, we made one change to the reward structure of the games during training only. As the scale of scores varies greatly from game to game, we clipped all positive rewards at 1 and all negative rewards at 21, leaving 0 rewards unchanged. Clipping the rewards in this manner limits the scale of the error derivatives and makes it easier to use the same learning rate across multiple games. At the same time, it could affect the performance of our agent since it cannot differentiate between rewards of different magnitude. For games where there is a life counter, the Atari 2600 emulator also sends the number of lives left in the game, which is then used to mark the end of an episode during training.
In these experiments, we used the RMSProp (see http://www.cs.toronto.edu/ ,tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf ) algorithm with minibatches of size 32. The behaviour policy during training was e-greedy with e annealed linearly from 1.0 to 0.1 over the first million frames, and fixed at 0.1 thereafter. We trained for a total of 50 million frames (that is, around 38 days of game experience in total) and used a replay memory of 1 million most recent frames.
Following previous approaches to playing Atari 2600 games, we also use a simple frame-skipping technique15. More precisely, the agent sees and selects actions on every th frame instead of every frame, and its last action is repeated on skipped
k frames. Because running the emulator forward for one step requires much less computation than having the agent select an action, this technique allows the agent to play roughly times more games without significantly increasing the runtime.
k We use 5 4 for all games.
k The values of all the hyperparameters and optimization parameters were selected by performing an informal search on the games Pong, Breakout, Seaquest, Space Invaders and Beam Rider. We did not perform a systematic grid search owing to the high computational cost. These parameters were then held fixed across all other games. The values and descriptions of all hyperparameters are provided in Extended Data Table 1.

Our experimental setup amounts to using the following minimal prior know-

ledge: that the input data consisted of visual images (motivating our use of a con-

volutional deep network), the game-specific score (with no modification), number

of actions, although not their correspondences (for example, specification of the

up ‘button’) and the life count. Evaluation procedure. The trained agents were evaluated by playing each game

30 times for up to 5 min each time with different initial random conditions (‘no-

op’; see Extended Data Table 1) and an e-greedy policy with e 5 0.05. This pro-

cedure is adopted to minimize the possibility of overfitting during evaluation. The

random agent served as a baseline comparison and chose a random action at 10 Hz

which is every sixth frame, repeating its last action on intervening frames. 10 Hz is

about the fastest that a human player can select the ‘fire’ button, and setting the

random agent to this frequency avoids spurious baseline scores in a handful of the

games. We did also assess the performance of a random agent that selected an action

at 60 Hz (that is, every frame). This had a minimal effect: changing the normalized

DQN performance by more than 5% in only six games (Boxing, Breakout, Crazy

Climber, Demon Attack, Krull and Robotank), and in all these games DQN out-

performed the expert human by a considerable margin.

The professional human tester used the same emulator engine as the agents, and

played under controlled conditions. The human tester was not allowed to pause,

save or reload games. As in the original Atari 2600 environment, the emulator was

run at 60 Hz and the audio output was disabled: as such, the sensory input was

equated between human player and agents. The human performance is the average

reward achieved from around 20 episodes of each game lasting a maximum of 5 min

each, following around 2 h of practice playing each game.

Algorithm. We consider tasks in which an agent interacts with an environment,

in this case the Atari emulator, in a sequence of actions, observations and rewards.

At each time-step the agent selects an action from the set of legal game actions, at
A~f1, . . . ,Kg. The action is passed to the emulator and modifies its internal state and the game score. In general the environment may be stochastic. The emulator’s

internal state is not observed by the agent; instead the agent observes an image

[ Rd from the emulator, which is a vector of pixel values representing the current xt screen. In addition it receives a reward representing the change in game score.
rt Note that in general the game score may depend on the whole previous sequence of

actions and observations; feedback about an action may only be received after many

thousands of time-steps have elapsed.

Because the agent only observes the current screen, the task is partially observed33

and many emulator states are perceptually aliased (that is, it is impossible to fully

understand the current situation from only the current screen ). Therefore, xt
sequences of actions and observations, st~x1,a1,x2,:::,at{1,xt, are input to the algorithm, which then learns game strategies depending upon these sequences. All

sequences in the emulator are assumed to terminate in a finite number of time-

steps. This formalism gives rise to a large but finite Markov decision process (MDP)

in which each sequence is a distinct state. As a result, we can apply standard rein-

forcement learning methods for MDPs, simply by using the complete sequence st
as the state representation at time t.
The goal of the agent is to interact with the emulator by selecting actions in a way

that maximizes future rewards. We make the standard assumption that future rewards

are discounted by a factor of c per time-step (c was set to 0.99 throughout), and

define the future discounted return at time as

Note that the targets depend on the network weights; this is in contrast with the

Rather than computing the full expectations in the above gradient, it is often

computationally expedient to optimize the loss function by stochastic gradient

descent. The familiar Q-learning algorithm19 can be recovered in this framework

by updating the weights after every time step, replacing the expectations using

often selected by an e-greedy policy that follows the greedy policy with probability

1 2 e and selects a random action with probability e. Training algorithm for deep Q-networks. The full algorithm for training deep

Q-networks is presented in Algorithm 1. The agent selects and executes actions

according to an e-greedy policy based on Q. Because using histories of arbitrary

length as inputs to a neural network can be difficult, our Q-function instead works

on a fixed length representation of histories produced by the function w described

above. The algorithm modifies standard online Q-learning in two ways to make it

suitable for training large neural networks without diverging.

First, we use a technique known as experience replay23 in which we store the

agent’s

{e1,…,et},

pooled over many episodes (where the end of an episode occurs when a termi-

nal state is reached) into a replay memory. During the inner loop of the algorithm,

we apply Q-learning updates, or minibatch updates, to samples of experience, (s, a, r, s9) , U(D), drawn at random from the pool of stored samples. This approach
has several advantages over standard online Q-learning. First, each step of experience

is potentially used in many weight updates, which allows for greater data efficiency.

Second, learning directly from consecutive samples is inefficient, owing to the strong

correlations between the samples; randomizing the samples breaks these correla-

tions and therefore reduces the variance of the updates. Third, when learning on-

policy the current parameters determine the next data sample that the parameters

are trained on. For example, if the maximizing action is to move left then the train-

ing samples will be dominated by samples from the left-hand side; if the maximiz-

ing action then switches to the right then the training distribution will also switch.

It is easy to see how unwanted feedback loops may arise and the parameters could get

stuck in a poor local minimum, or even diverge catastrophically20. By using experience

replay the behaviour distribution is averaged over many of its previous states,

smoothing out learning and avoiding oscillations or divergence in the parameters.

Note that when learning by experience replay, it is necessary to learn off-policy

(because our current parameters are different to those used to generate the sam-

ple), which motivates the choice of Q-learning.

In practice, our algorithm only stores the last experience tuples in the replay N
memory, and samples uniformly at random from D when performing updates. This approach is in some respects limited because the memory buffer does not differ-

entiate important transitions and always overwrites with recent transitions owing

to the finite memory size . Similarly, the uniform sampling gives equal imporN
tance to all transitions in the replay memory. A more sophisticated sampling strat-

egy might emphasize transitions from which we can learn the most, similar to prioritized sweeping30.

The second modification to online Q-learning aimed at further improving the

stability of our method with neural networks is to use a separate network for gen-

erating the targets in the Q-learning update. More precisely, every updates we

Extended Data Figure 1 | Two-dimensional t-SNE embedding of the representations in the last hidden layer assigned by DQN to game states experienced during a combination of human and agent play in Space Invaders. The plot was generated by running the t-SNE algorithm25 on the last
hidden layer representation assigned by DQN to game states experienced
during a combination of human (30 min) and agent (2 h) play. The fact that
there is similar structure in the two-dimensional embeddings corresponding to
the DQN representation of states experienced during human play (orange

points) and DQN play (blue points) suggests that the representations learned by DQN do indeed generalize to data generated from policies other than its own. The presence in the t-SNE embedding of overlapping clusters of points corresponding to the network representation of states experienced during human and agent play shows that the DQN agent also follows sequences of states similar to those found in human play. Screenshots corresponding to selected states are shown (human: orange border; DQN: blue border).

Extended Data Figure 2 | Visualization of learned value functions on two games, Breakout and Pong. a, A visualization of the learned value function on the game Breakout. At time points 1 and 2, the state value is predicted to be ,17
and the agent is clearing the bricks at the lowest level. Each of the peaks in
the value function curve corresponds to a reward obtained by clearing a brick.
At time point 3, the agent is about to break through to the top level of bricks and the value increases to ,21 in anticipation of breaking out and clearing a
large set of bricks. At point 4, the value is above 23 and the agent has broken
through. After this point, the ball will bounce at the upper part of the bricks clearing many of them by itself. b, A visualization of the learned action-value
function on the game Pong. At time point 1, the ball is moving towards the
paddle controlled by the agent on the right side of the screen and the values of

all actions are around 0.7, reflecting the expected value of this state based on previous experience. At time point 2, the agent starts moving the paddle towards the ball and the value of the ‘up’ action stays high while the value of the ‘down’ action falls to 20.9. This reflects the fact that pressing ‘down’ would lead to the agent losing the ball and incurring a reward of 21. At time point 3, the agent hits the ball by pressing ‘up’ and the expected reward keeps increasing until time point 4, when the ball reaches the left edge of the screen and the value of all actions reflects that the agent is about to receive a reward of 1. Note, the dashed line shows the past trajectory of the ball purely for illustrative purposes (that is, not shown during the game). With permission from Atari Interactive, Inc.

Each agent was evaluated every 250,000 training frames for 135,000 validation frames and the highest average episode score is reported. Note that these evaluation episodes were not truncated at 5 min leading to higher scores on Enduro than the ones reported in Extended Data Table 2.
